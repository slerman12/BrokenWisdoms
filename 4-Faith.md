Message about preferring to die to legal action

> Date: **10/30/23**

I almost said “It makes me want to die” in the [mass email of 10/30/23](https://github.com/slerman12/BrokenWisdoms/blob/main/3-Disproof.md#email-10302023). Thankfully a friend in a group chat of several people suggested to the contrary, or else the University of Rochester might’ve been responsible for doing another coerced hospitalization on me, and a repeat of the cycle of unforeseen consequences from involuntary invasive and drug interventions on me. Either way, however, they could have *plausibly* been responsible for a student and worker's suicide.

### Enemies

Rewind to August, before the six-month review deadline and after I was notified of my stipend and advisor-cut. I took my best friend into this, asking for his advice on an email that I sent, and stating my plans (or lackthereof) regarding legal action:

</br>We were discussing [this email (of 08/10/23)](https://github.com/slerman12/BrokenWisdoms/blob/Ancillary/Not-Enough-Carbs.md).

I sent them this email exactly as I showed my friend. That was the best I was able to phrase everything (for whatever reason, perhaps due to revisiting the trauma, my consciousness wasn't in the best state). All of what had gone on was conveyed to them as early as the beginning of August, at least as much as could be summarized in less than a book. Following which, here is how my friend and I discussed it afterwards:

## Synchronicities

Meanwhile, before and after, astonishing synchronicities were happening that I will list below and leave for your judgement on their metaphysical or coincidental nature.

### Deus Ex Memory

- Indeed, my faith regarding sending my sincere description of the traumas, despite the difficulty of doing so, was somewhat rewarded, though probably not by their conscious intent, rather by a lucky [“Deus Ex Memory”](https://github.com/slerman12/BrokenWisdoms/blob/Ancillary/Deus-Ex-Memory.md), wherein one of the 3 committee members (accidentally) recorded to official record that he really-extraordinarily didn’t remember the details of the meeting on which all of this was based. 
 - Following this [“Deus Ex Memory”](https://github.com/slerman12/BrokenWisdoms/blob/Ancillary/Deus-Ex-Memory.md) exchange with Chris Kanan, I had yet another reply I wanted to send afterwards that would’ve ruined the conclusive punctuation of the previous, and by chance my internet went down or some disruption to the internet happened after hitting send and I was really lucky that it didn’t go through, leaving this exchange on the note of “we all know what just happened,” and a strong discredit to the committee's judgement-making thoughtfulness and memory.
- This is the same Chris Kanan who gave the [one and only concrete research suggestion](), which I ended up following [exceptionally and on proven GitHub record]() before the termination decisions, and didn't just get no credit, but also the judgement that I “refused to follow” committee advice as the justification for the termination decision, despite the advice being disproportionately hard and intense (“invent a new RL systems algorithm before the next meeting”, [paraphrasing]()), and having done it quite extraordinarily really via a novel accelerated parallel priority experience replay with sampling-without-replacement algorithm with memory-mapping, and truly-shared RAM. There was nothing like it, still isn’t, and it’s by far the best RL implementation of experience replay and adjacent sampling algorithms, as well as being novel as an algorithm itself via the sampling-without-replacement, which I described to my advisor’s satisfaction in literally the meeting in which he next notified me of my stipend and advisor-cut, since that was his intent for the meeting. 
- There was also [one more synchronicity]() involving Chris Kanan that I’ll leave for Ancillary.
- I never met Chris Kanan in person and my advisor suggested him as one of the last-minute replacement committee members. Note: I don't think he should be punished for this. I think whatever powers-that-be that regulate his consciousness proved stronger than the ones that facilitate the atmosphere/landscape of the formal University of Rochester, and did good amid impossible programming.

I finished making this [diagram](https://github.com/slerman12/Detective-Sam/assets/9126603/497f6d9b-ff12-4e6a-97c5-e5230c05e505) just as Pink Floyd's [Comfortably Numb](https://youtu.be/_FrOQC-zEog?si=riY-TNigVjimQ_iT) started playing on my Spotify, a song about a doctor taking a patient named "Pink"'s soul through "medicines" meant to help him. The next song was "Psycho Killer" which I'll interpret as psychiatric killer. Oh and then "Alabama  Song (Whisky Bar)." Not bad. Any song about alcohol is fitting for the topic of benzos, since they both work by GABA as the mechanism of action. In fact, I introduced a fellow hospital-inmate Lily to Elliott Smith for the first time in the hospital with the song [Between the Bars](https://youtu.be/2FmYzACF-kg?si=DLaBako9OolIYuVx) (about alcohol... not about Xanax bars, though Xanax is another benzo and "bars" is the colloquially and sometimes clinically used term for pills of them) while we were in the hospital (linguistically like: between the bars of confinement). Since, also synchronistically, she was keeping a synchronicity list while we were there, I think she'll appreciate these observations in this caption when I show her, though it would unfortunately be a non-sequitor to make any claims to their nature or significance. Some of these however are just linguistic.
