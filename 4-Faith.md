Message about preferring to die than legal action

> Date: **10/30/23**

Screenshot

I almost said “It makes me want to die” in the [mass email of 10/30/23](https://github.com/slerman12/BrokenWisdoms/blob/main/3-Disproof.md#email-10302023). Thankfully a friend in a group chat of several people suggested otherwise, or else the University of Rochester might’ve been responsible for doing another coerced hospitalization of me, and a repeat of the cycle of unforeseen consequences from involuntary interventions on me. Either way, however, they could have *plausibly* been responsible for a student and worker's suicide.

### Enemies

Rewind to August, before the six-month review deadline and after I was notified of my stipend and advisor-cut. I took my best friend into this, asking for his advice on an email that I sent, and stating my plans (or lackthereof) regarding legal action:

</br>We were discussing [this email (of 08/10/23)](https://github.com/slerman12/BrokenWisdoms/blob/Ancillary/Not-Enough-Carbs.md).

I sent them this email exactly as I showed my friend. That was the best I was able to phrase everything (for whatever reason, perhaps due to revisiting the trauma, my consciousness and my corresponding linguistics weren't in the best state). All of what had gone on was conveyed to them as early as the beginning of August, at least as much as could be summarized in less than a book. Following which, here is how my best friend and I discussed it afterwards:

## Synchronicities

Meanwhile, before and after, astonishing [synchronicities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synchronicity) happened that can be listed below and I leave for your judgement on their metaphysical or coincidental nature.

### Chris Kanan (Deus ex memory)

- Indeed, my faith regarding sending my sincere description of the traumas, despite the difficulty of doing so, was somewhat rewarded, though probably not by their conscious intent, rather by a lucky [“Deus Ex Memory”](https://github.com/slerman12/BrokenWisdoms/blob/Ancillary/Deus-Ex-Memory.md), wherein one of the 3 committee members (accidentally) recorded to official record that he really-extraordinarily didn’t remember the details of the meeting on which their termination was based.
- Following this [“Deus Ex Memory”](https://github.com/slerman12/BrokenWisdoms/blob/Ancillary/Deus-Ex-Memory.md) exchange with Chris Kanan, I had yet another reply I wanted to send afterwards that would’ve ruined the conclusive punctuation of the previous, and by chance my internet went down or some disruption to the internet happened after hitting send and I was really lucky that it didn’t go through, leaving this exchange on the note of “we all know what just happened,” and a strong discredit to the committee's judgement-making, thoughtfulness, and memory.
- This is the same Chris Kanan who gave the [one and only concrete research suggestion](), which I ended up following [exceptionally and on proven GitHub record]() before the termination decisions, and didn't just get no credit, but also the judgement that I “refused to follow” committee advice as the justification for the termination decision, despite the advice being disproportionately hard and intense (“invent a new RL systems algorithm before the next meeting”, [paraphrasing]()), and having done it quite extraordinarily really via a novel accelerated parallel priority experience replay with sampling-without-replacement algorithm with memory-mapping, and truly-shared RAM. There was nothing like it, still isn’t, and it’s by far the best RL implementation of experience replay and adjacent sampling algorithms, as well as being novel as an algorithm itself via the sampling-without-replacement, which I described to my advisor’s satisfaction in literally the meeting in which he next notified me of my stipend and advisor-cut, since that was his intent for the meeting.
- The theme of memory is a big coincidence in itself since what I implemented was a large-scale, dynamically growable, rewritable, truly shared RAM and adaptive memory-mapping across devices parallelized lifelong replay memory. [TO DO: Stress this way more]
- There was also [one more synchronicity]() involving Chris Kanan that I’ll leave for Ancillary.
- I never met Chris Kanan in person and my advisor suggested him as one of the last-minute replacement committee members. Note: I don't think he should be punished for this. I think whatever powers-that-be that regulate his consciousness proved stronger than the ones that facilitate the atmosphere/landscape of the formal University of Rochester, and did good amid impossible programming.

### Jordan Peterson

My benzo trauma was with a [comparatively](https://www.mdcalc.com/calc/10091/benzodiazepine-conversion-calculator) higher dose than what Jordan Peterson took (he took approximately 12% - 80% the dose I did, and that's when I was taking them at the lowest dose the psychiatrists had reduced to), and preceded the situation Mikhaila Peterson, his daughter, described ([originally on her channel](https://youtu.be/laheAXdZK7w)), about how the professional psychoanalyst was caught off guard by the severe damages that the drugs caused, wherein he took [0.5 mg](https://ashnavabi.com/2022/01/19/jordan-peterson-was-not-addicted-to-benzos/) of [Clonazepam](https://windwardway.com/rehab-blog/jordan-peterson-finishes-lengthy-treatment-for-addiction/) per day as prescribed, reportedly, and unlike him I didn’t have the entire Russian army brigade bringing me into health (he went to Russia, where they were the first to have the medicine and specialized treatment to help him).

### Mikhaila Peterson

Prior to that, by coincidence, his daughter Mikhaila (thankfully) recommended the steak-only diet (for an independent thing), which is where I heard it from, a clip from her podcast. That’s a global-level synchronicity involving them that happened after I was put through all of this crisis, which contributed to bringing me out, as well as my hair growing back, thanks to her diet recommendation.

I finished making this [benzo-timeline diagram](https://github.com/slerman12/Detective-Sam/assets/9126603/497f6d9b-ff12-4e6a-97c5-e5230c05e505) just as Pink Floyd's [Comfortably Numb](https://youtu.be/_FrOQC-zEog?si=riY-TNigVjimQ_iT) started playing on my Spotify's radio on shuffle, a song about a doctor taking a patient named "Pink"'s soul through "medicines" meant to help him. The next song was Psycho Killer which I'll interpret as psychiatric killer. Oh and then Alabama  Song (Whisky Bar). Not bad. Rgearding Whiskey Bar, any song about alcohol is fitting for the topic of benzos, since they both work by GABA as the mechanism of action. In fact, I introduced a fellow hospital-inmate Lily to Elliott Smith for the first time in the hospital with the song [Between the Bars](https://youtu.be/2FmYzACF-kg?si=DLaBako9OolIYuVx) (about alcohol... not about Xanax bars, though Xanax is another benzo and "bars" is the colloquially and sometimes clinically used term for pills of them) while we were in the hospital (linguistically like: between the bars of confinement). It was the only song I thought to show her in the one situation when we were allowed to pick our own music, and she remembered and liked it. Also coincidentally, she was keeping a synchronicity list while we were there. While some of these are clearly just linguistic, the timing of [Comfortably Numb](https://youtu.be/_FrOQC-zEog?si=riY-TNigVjimQ_iT) and the next two songs seems worth noting since many people, like Lily and myself, appreciate synchronicities. Two more: (1) speaking of timing, the [diagram](https://github.com/slerman12/Detective-Sam/assets/9126603/497f6d9b-ff12-4e6a-97c5-e5230c05e505) is about a chronology (not of songs, but of benzo trauma), and (2) Lily’s last name is phonetically pronounced "Jung," the depth psychologist who coined synchronicities.

### CMT deletion of record

CMT (the portal that was used to submit to the "NIPS" 2018 conference, today called NeurIPS) deleted their record of my MHDPA innovation paper, the one that foretold ChatGPT to my university's professors (or tried to), the same month when I was terminated (CMT’s deleting of that record at around that time can be verified, since they sent out a notification email on 10/20/23 to everybody that they were updating their data retention policy). But in 2018, the paper was sent out to Henry Kautz and Daniel Gildea by email, and submitted to the class as that class’s end of semester project also via email. So the digital record does remain to verify the paper and its being written in 2018 with the first initial successful experiments, and email record of Henry and Dan's respective advice on how to mathematically or linguistically describe MHDPA, claiming more math was needed and that “relational reasoning” is the wrong term (though what I had and stuck with is now the convention, and already had some precedent then). That’s not to insult Henry or Dan. There’s also clear record that, most deep learning and natural language processing researchers, even outside of the University of Rochester, [weren't too abundantly "foretelling" of MHDPA's importance](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=mhdpa&hl=en&as_sdt=0%2C33&as_ylo=2017&as_yhi=2018) (the link is to two papers that were, the earliest papers to use MHDPA at all, also from 2018, and others that just directly referenced it) at the time of my paper. Both of those two papers used MHDPA for something fundamentally new, but neither innovated directly on MHDPA, meaning mine was probably the first to do so, ever. While I was finishing up the code for my MHDPA innovation in Montreal during NeurIPS (called "NIPS" at the time) 2018, I met one of the authors of [one of those two papers](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2018/hash/e2eabaf96372e20a9e3d4b5f83723a61-Abstract.html), Ryan Faulkner, and we got lunch and he said he'd recommend me to a position at DeepMind (he was miraculously impressed with me). 

And not only foretold to my university's professors, but innovated on and executed successful experiments verifying the early innovation — and formal paper submission, later derailed by me having to switch advisors, fields, and put on deadlines, not to mention all of their doubt, skepticism, and lack of enthsuiasm (oh but enthusiasm came later when MHDPA exploded, with Henry even telling me on email record, after he was no longer my advisor, that I should work on vision transformers!).

### Sam "Altman"

The head of OpenAI, the company that invented ChatGPT (that used MHDPA), whose name is "Sam Altman" (mine is Sam Lerman) — "Altman" — was terminated as the head of OpenAI in an unusually sensationalized situation exactly 17 days after my termination.

### "Life ruined" post, entire-forum being deleted 5 months after I emailed it to the faculty/administrators 

Description [after having shown it to Niaz who commented in person about it, and writing BrokenWisdoms as a result of the depression and fear that came from losing my only description of those events, one I hadn’t backed up anywhere, with comments from others about having experienced similar things, the trauma of benzodiazepine addiction/coercion, and expressing extreme sympathy, and it was the top post in that for 4-ish years running]

### House on May St. 

I was working really hard in that house, developing my long-term memory research ideas and implementing the code for it there, meditating every day while practicing strict dietary (Paleo) disciplines, while working on campus taking full semesters of grad-level classes, and at the University of Rochester's Medical Center, building neural models to predict the progression of Parkinson's disease, and that house is where I started to get my idea for how stochasticity in the universe's quantum mechanics could explain a mechanism for "God" or some intelligent power in nature, hypothetically.

I was sleeping, when, on a rare occasion, my housemate friend and his girlfriend woke me climbing up the stairs. Somehow I had a sudden realization, near around 3 AM or whatever time it was in that night, that the universe's particles might be random, and therefore can be shifted by slight standard deviations by an intelligence — like the biological or artificial kind — in such a way that still respects the known laws of physics and yet permits the possibility of an intelligent nature, that can modulate how those particles are sampled with respect to the sampling distributions.

### Physics

Description [Revelatory insights about the universe as a differentiable brain in my 2nd year, with that fascination returning to me regularly thereafter. Then in my 3rd/4th year, a 5-minute but-urgent/vivid/visceral conversation with my uncle (an optics physicist, about applying deep learning models to his work, involving optics, including behavior of light, for my PhD) just before — by chance — being put on the XRD (meaning, light diffraction) project by Chenliang, and, since being terminated, me coming up with a [unified wave theory](https://github.com/animal-tree/Writing-stuff-2/blob/main/Theories/Unified-Wave-Theory.md) (involving a differentiable, intelligence-optimizable, simulation of the universe) showing the agreement of my wave theory with measurement primarily through light multi-slit diffraction (analogous to XRD) experiments]
