I can't be indebted. that's insane. the university of rochester took my life from me and left me with nothing except my mom. now i have to pay my student debts to them, after doctors working for them put me through medical malpractice. The university terminated me for only publishing 2 papers in 3 years under Chenliang, while advisors and committee members abandoned their responsibilities to pursue promotions and more-efficient publication rates. I have the hair of Gollum due to the full-body hair loss that they medically inflicted.

I can hear your inner voice, dear reader, just asking why I don't sue. You don't understand what happened to me. I am not Sam leaving the Shire. I'm Frodo after Mordor. And I would rather sail to the Gray Havens, literally, my dear friend, than fight another day for money. 

Not to mention, the later benzodiazepine coercions and lies that induced brain damage on me after as well, that my trauma memory doesn't easily let me elaborate on.

"What is it you want?" - I ask on your behalf, talking to myself, a bit too much like Gollum.

I want the university to apologize for its actions, take accountability, and remediate the damages. More generally, I have had my faith in humanity destroyed and I want my faith in humanity, and a reason to want to live, [restored](https://github.com/slerman12/Help-me/blob/main/4-Faith.md).

Here is some of the work I did and had to do for them at less than minimum wage:

(neural) Architecture Systems:

1. Open-source library: https://www.github.com/AGI-init/UnifiedML-legacy
2. Open-source slides: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1JpT09GMN0xa81J1h88urRklcOZkJ704s58LHHikmUG8/edit?usp=sharing

Teaching (professors and students):

1. Temporal dynamics: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1FsN1zniVRPjnGCMkminigHOrzXPUQIYe_bREbg7WU8M/edit?usp=sharing
2. Multi-phase Classification figures for their second grant (that I also helped write):  https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1mNgtyuTHR99Io8N3kbfbJcucTKeH98bdl9XY1QBW7Lw/edit?usp=sharing
3. Description of biological neurons as LSTMs: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1i5hS2iDVuo24PnGicvn5dIZYXUzDfPAl/view?usp=share_link (this one was personal)
4. Ideas, e.g., I think this is a good example: https://github.com/slerman12/Detective-Sam/blob/Ancillary/Conv-is-all-you-need.md
5. Many useful diagrams, e.g. [here](https://private-user-images.githubusercontent.com/9126603/293291504-d598721d-c5e0-4c87-bf30-914681777965.png?jwt=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.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.LYvh8X_mQfkBuVXaYOiY1uF9IJDmearKm4J-Dj8HBb8)
6. Pytorch lecture: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1RylmVCn6IStbXv4zSdG6LMK3OfLDjsRstA4mRNls3ho/edit?usp=sharing)
7. Neural Crystallography (which, in practice, had little to do with my actual research): https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Z7RpzigzFAgnurscUSIBFX0aAZuxr81T-yqPIFz5fKg/edit?usp=sharing

And countless weekly paper reviews, project summaries, updates on work done, every week. Since I was in two labs, instead of just one like Chenliang's other students, I had to give these updates on two separate independent sets of projects every week for 3 years, meaning I was entirely monitored and supervised in every action, and yet terminated for a "missed six-month review."

Robotics:

1. Robo 1: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/18SbDI_gDK3ashBhhZuG0pbKU91bwCkTpyR3LKjj5_Vo/edit?usp=sharing
2. Robo 2: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Zm-uNjS6D80Oi44kSVuX-6VHBAvCYBnAYh0541oU4nM/edit?usp=sharing
3. Open-source: https://github.com/AGI-init/tributaries/blob/main/Examples/Sweeps/Bittle.py

Top-venue paper publication, that I had to do under force in less than 2 months while literally brain damaged (literally, physiologically, by that very institution, due to benzodiazepine coercions and malpractice) or else I would lose funding due to my first advisor being promoted to a directing position at the NSF and my second one not wanting to accept me into his lab unless I wrote a top-venue paper immediately:

1. Paper: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.08601.pdf
2. Poster: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1nI8dKitjOy0yLsIpJHKNF1nnfOnydpXOBobXi9s2-eY/edit?usp=sharing)
3. Video: https://youtu.be/P08ZNFxMh7Q?si=KwNnGlIA7PdXF5zR)

[Another paper publication](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1nZFXtz2hJQlAsiLW-nuxRDPh97-UAj_g7eN326vTL8k/edit?usp=sharing) </br>
[And a whole GitHub for them, including the data generation and pipeline, and all of the experiments](https://github.com/AGI-init/XRDs/tree/main) </br>
And helped write their million-dollar grant, including coming up with, proposing, and teaching the main ideas, uncredited.
