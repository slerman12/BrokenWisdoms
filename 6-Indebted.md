# Indebted

## Part 6 ([Continued](https://github.com/slerman12/BrokenWisdoms/blob/main/5-Early-work-in-program.md))

> This chapter is in progress.

I can't be indebted. that's insane. the university of rochester took my life from me and left me with nothing except my mom. now i have to pay my student debts to them, after doctors working for them put me through medical malpractice. The university terminated me for only publishing 2 papers in 3 years under Chenliang, while advisors and committee members abandoned their responsibilities to pursue promotions and more-efficient publication rates. I have the hair of Gollum due to the full-body hair loss that they medically inflicted.

I can hear your inner voice, dear reader, just asking why I don't sue. You don't understand what happened to me. I am not Sam leaving the Shire. I'm Frodo after Mordor. And I would rather sail to the Gray Havens, literally, my dear friend, than fight another day for money. 

Not to mention, the later benzodiazepine coercions and lies that induced brain damage on me after as well, that my trauma memory doesn't easily let me elaborate on.

"What is it you want?" - I ask on your behalf, talking to myself, a bit too much like Gollum.

I want the university to apologize for its actions, take accountability, and remediate the damages of their own volitions by their own proclaimed principles. More generally, my faith in humanity, a reason to want to live, [restored](https://github.com/slerman12/BrokenWisdoms/blob/main/4-Faith.md), and for the many things that happened to me to not be possible in this world anymore.

Here is some of the work I did or had to do for them at less than minimum wage:

(neural) Architecture Systems:

1. Generously-released AI open-source library from which I made no money due to it being unfinished due to the university’s termination of support, even calling it “unviable”: https://www.github.com/AGI-init/UnifiedML-legacy
2. Open-source slides: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1JpT09GMN0xa81J1h88urRklcOZkJ704s58LHHikmUG8/edit?usp=sharing

Teaching (professors and students):

1. Temporal dynamics: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1FsN1zniVRPjnGCMkminigHOrzXPUQIYe_bREbg7WU8M/edit?usp=sharing
2. Multi-phase Classification figures for their second grant (that I also helped write):  https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1mNgtyuTHR99Io8N3kbfbJcucTKeH98bdl9XY1QBW7Lw/edit?usp=sharing
3. Description of biological neurons as LSTMs: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1i5hS2iDVuo24PnGicvn5dIZYXUzDfPAl/view?usp=share_link (this one was personal)
4. Ideas, e.g., I think this is a good [example](https://github.com/slerman12/BrokenWisdoms/blob/Ancillary/Conv-is-all-you-need.md)
5. Many useful diagrams, e.g. [here](https://private-user-images.githubusercontent.com/9126603/293291504-d598721d-c5e0-4c87-bf30-914681777965.png?jwt=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.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.LYvh8X_mQfkBuVXaYOiY1uF9IJDmearKm4J-Dj8HBb8)
6. Pytorch lecture: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1RylmVCn6IStbXv4zSdG6LMK3OfLDjsRstA4mRNls3ho/edit?usp=sharing)
7. Neural Crystallography (which I guess they had me do for fun): https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Z7RpzigzFAgnurscUSIBFX0aAZuxr81T-yqPIFz5fKg/edit?usp=sharing

And countless weekly paper reviews, project summaries, updates on work done, every week. Since I was in two labs, instead of just one like Chenliang's other students, I had to give these updates on two separate independent sets of projects every week for 3 years, meaning I was entirely monitored and supervised in every action, and yet terminated for a missed six-month review make-up (after being terminated).

Robotics:

1. Robo 1: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/18SbDI_gDK3ashBhhZuG0pbKU91bwCkTpyR3LKjj5_Vo/edit?usp=sharing
2. Robo 2: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Zm-uNjS6D80Oi44kSVuX-6VHBAvCYBnAYh0541oU4nM/edit?usp=sharing
3. Open-source: https://github.com/AGI-init/tributaries/blob/main/Examples/Sweeps/Bittle.py

Top-venue paper publication, that I had to do under force in less than 2 months while literally brain damaged (literally, physiologically, by that very institution, due to benzodiazepine coercions and malpractice) or else I would lose funding due to my first advisor being promoted to a directing position at the NSF and my second one not wanting to accept me into his lab unless I wrote and submitted a top-venue paper immediately:

1. Published Paper: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.08601.pdf
2. Poster: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1nI8dKitjOy0yLsIpJHKNF1nnfOnydpXOBobXi9s2-eY/edit?usp=sharing)
3. Video: https://youtu.be/P08ZNFxMh7Q?si=KwNnGlIA7PdXF5zR)

Then another paper publication, and more, for a paper that was under review when my advisor decided I didn’t have enough papers, just before it was accepted.

[Another paper publication](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1nZFXtz2hJQlAsiLW-nuxRDPh97-UAj_g7eN326vTL8k/edit?usp=sharing) </br>
[And a whole GitHub for them, including the data generation and pipeline, and all of the experiments](https://github.com/AGI-init/XRDs/tree/main) </br>
And helped write their almost-million-dollar grant, including coming up with, proposing, and teaching some of the main ideas, uncredited.

That’s a lot of money I helped bring into their institution to be supposedly indebted many thousands to them, an institution responsible for coerced permanent damage against me, literal torture, and blatant abuse of my hard work.

Work that I did — meaning, fully implemented, as described below — that was rejected by the brand new interim committee and called "unviable" by the department chair:

[Plug-and-play substitute for Pytorch DataLoader, better in every way, leveraging truly-shared memory from scratch accelerated across domains, and with the best possible interface for use in reinforcement learning as an experience replay, prioritized experience replay, or other parallel, distributed, algorithmically novel versions, including priority-sampling without replacement by multiple parallel-CPU workers and memory-mapping, fully unified with dynamically growable and agent-re-writable online dataset and curriculum capability, and even support for cross-device (e.g. GPU) memory pre-allocation of datasets dynamically beyond just pre-fetching mini-batches, supporting data loading/collecting/real-time-learning, online or offline, on-policy and off-policy, across every conceivable learning domain and implemented elegantly.](https://github.com/slerman12/Builder/blob/main/UnifiedML/src/ML/World/Replay.py)

> TO DO: Really summarize my work, including the above run-on sentence, long-term memory, architectures, unified framework, GATO multi-task, Bittle, and so much more.
