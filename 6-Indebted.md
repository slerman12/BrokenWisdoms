I can't be indebted. that's insane. the university of rochester took my life from me and left me with nothing except my mom. now i have to pay my student debts to them, after doctors working for them put me through multiple unnecessary and preventable physical and mental traumas, and the university terminated me for only publishing 2 papers in 3 years under Chenliang, while committee members changed and left during my PhD through no fault of my own, a policy he enforces due to the pressure of the AI field to publish more often.

I can hear your inner voice, dear reader, just asking why I don't sue. You don't understand what happened to me. I am not Sam leaving the Shire. I'm Frodo after Mordor. And I would rather sail to the gray havens, literally, my dear friend, than fight another day for money. I have the hair of Gollum however due to the full-body hair loss that they caused.

Not to mention, the later benzodiazepine coercions and lies that induced brain damage on me after as well, that my trauma memory hasn't let me elaborate on again since a public post I made in a prescription-pill recovery forum that was banned and deleted 5 months ago.

"What is it you want?" - I ask on your behalf, talking to myself, a bit too much like Gollum.

I want the university to apologize for its actions, take accountability, and remediate the damages. More generally, I have had my faith in humanity destroyed and I want my faith in humanity, and a reason to want to live, [restored](https://github.com/slerman12/Help-me/blob/main/4-Faith.md).

Here is some of the work I did and had to do for them at less than minimum wage, as of course many witnesses can confirm:

(neural) Architecture Systems:

1. Open-source library: https://www.github.com/AGI-init/UnifiedML-legacy
2. Open-source slides: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1JpT09GMN0xa81J1h88urRklcOZkJ704s58LHHikmUG8/edit?usp=sharing

Teaching (professors and students):

1. Temporal dynamics: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1FsN1zniVRPjnGCMkminigHOrzXPUQIYe_bREbg7WU8M/edit?usp=sharing
2. Multi-phase Classification: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1mNgtyuTHR99Io8N3kbfbJcucTKeH98bdl9XY1QBW7Lw/edit?usp=sharing
3. Pytorch: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1RylmVCn6IStbXv4zSdG6LMK3OfLDjsRstA4mRNls3ho/edit?usp=sharing)
4. Temporal dynamics modeling for physics: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1GQQSxlefA6s8TJ33TFRIwD5PryPNMe6GuwaYLBu5b7o/edit?usp=sharing
5. Description of biological neurons as LSTMs: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1i5hS2iDVuo24PnGicvn5dIZYXUzDfPAl/view?usp=share_link (this one was personal)
6. All of this: https://github.com/slerman12/Teaching/blob/master/Other%20materials/Diagrams.md
7. Neural Crystallography: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Z7RpzigzFAgnurscUSIBFX0aAZuxr81T-yqPIFz5fKg/edit?usp=sharing

And countless weekly paper reviews, project summaries, updates on work done, every week. Since I was in two labs, instead of just one like Chenliang's other students, I had to give these updates on two separate independent sets of projects every week for 3 years.

Robotics:

1. Robo 1: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1o1Gj0xp5T3eOn3thDBtjDofYNaa74jgyiP5yS0EKTKM/edit?usp=sharing
2. Robo 2: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/12zGyQoGM4x9d6qZ99hSQ2LfQwcfgfS-mMY8Ofd-sfeA/edit?usp=sharing
3. BittleBot: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/13tAT_JixcAt1-ym_0Gcw4yZ93siCoKRCwuTxYoEFWUA/edit?usp=sharing

Top-venue paper publication, that I had to do under force in less than 2 months while literally brain damaged (literally, physiologically, by that very institution, due to benzodiazepine coercions and malpractice) or else I would lose funding due to my first advisor being promoted and my second one not wanting to accept me into his lab unless I wrote a top-venue paper immediately:

1. Paper: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.08601.pdf
2. Poster: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1nI8dKitjOy0yLsIpJHKNF1nnfOnydpXOBobXi9s2-eY/edit?usp=sharing)
3. Video: https://youtu.be/P08ZNFxMh7Q?si=KwNnGlIA7PdXF5zR)

[Another paper publication](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1nZFXtz2hJQlAsiLW-nuxRDPh97-UAj_g7eN326vTL8k/edit?usp=sharing) </br>
[And a whole GitHub for them, including the data generation and pipeline, and all of the experiments](https://github.com/AGI-init/XRDs/tree/main) </br>
And helped write their million-dollar grant, uncredited.
