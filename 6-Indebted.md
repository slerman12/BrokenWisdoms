I can't be indebted. that's insane. the university of rochester took my life from me and left me with nothing except my mom. now i have to pay my student debts to them, after doctors working for them put me through multiple unnecessary and preventable physical and mental traumas, and the university terminated me for only publishing 2 papers in 3 years under Chenliang, while committee members changed and left during my PhD through no fault of my own, a policy he enforces due to the pressure of the AI field to publish more often.

I can hear your inner voice, dear reader, just asking why I don't sue. You don't understand what happened to me. I am not Sam leaving the Shire. I'm Frodo after Mordor. And I would rather sail to the gray havens, literally, my dear friend, than fight another day for money. I have the hair of Gollum however due to the full-body hair loss that they caused.

Not to mention, the later benzodiazepine coercions and lies that induced brain damage on me after as well, that my trauma memory hasn't let me elaborate on again since a public post I made in a prescription-pill recovery forum that was banned and deleted 5 months ago.

"What is it you want?" - I ask on your behalf, talking to myself, a bit too much like Gollum.

I want the university to apologize for its actions, take accountability, and remediate the damages. More generally, I have had my faith in humanity destroyed and I want my faith in humanity, and a reason to want to live, [restored](https://github.com/slerman12/Help-me/blob/main/4-Faith.md).
