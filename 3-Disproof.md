To: **CS grad department**</br>
From: **CS department chair**

Dear colleagues,

As members of the department’s many email lists, you may have received a note this afternoon raising questions about the experience of a graduate student.  While I cannot comment on any specific case, the faculty, staff, and administrators of the CS Department and the Hajim School remain (and have been) committed to fostering a just and supportive environment, and to following our stated policies, as outlined in the URCS PhD handbook, the UR Graduate Handbook, and our broader Vision and Values.

If you have any concerns, please feel free to reach out.
 
Yours,
 
Michael L. Scott (he/him)</br>

### Email: 10/30/2023

Subject line: **Re: [Grads] Supporting students**</br>
To: **CS grad department students**</br>
From: **Sam Lerman**

Michael, can you clarify where in the PhD handbook it says that a student with two publications (one pending) may be dismissed, last-minute and without prior warning, for “not enough papers” in their 6th year? In the middle of a paper-review response, by the way. Pending, with positive reviews. And having had no begrudging or otherwise “tacit” negative relationship with their advisor. Purely on that reason: “not enough papers”.

I know the reason was later modified to assert that my research over 6 years hasn’t been consistent. It has, with 2.5 hrs of weekly lab/group meetings with my advisor to ensure that it has, but the assertion itself was based on a 20-minute zoom meeting with a brand new committee.

Can I ask where in the PhD handbook it says that, if at the last minute a student’s committee members and/or advisor leave/get promoted/retire, that regardless of whether the student was notified in advance, that the computer science department would not in any way be responsible for sudden unwarned departures, and that the last-minute new committee’s opinions would be held as absolute? A committee whose advice following our one and only meeting was actually followed, as I reported to Chenliang on the day that he asserted that he would no longer support me in the Fall due to “not enough papers". 

Is it also permissible to ask where in the PhD handbook it says that a student in a rapidly changing tech field, is blamed for the rapid research changes that have to happen in that rapidly progressing field? The handbook should reflect accountability of the grad school for termination. That they need to give evidence, citing specific research examples, that the student over the course of their years of study, followed in opposition to advisor guidance. For example, my “UnifiedML” library, that I have been reporting on every week for about 3 years now, and is pretty much complete with novel robotics and foundation model methods equipped, was decided to be “unviable” in the very letter in which my stipend was formally terminated. How did those meetings, every week for many years, happen?

May I suggest an amendment to the PhD handbook? Perhaps it would be more fostering of justice and support if a PhD student’s research and contributions had to be weighed in the ruling about them as “inconsistent.”

May I also suggest that, if on email record the advisor is quoted as saying that the student has already done enough to successfully defend (indeed to do so as early as November, given that “you listen to my advice to format your thesis" correctly), that said student can’t in any just rationale be dismissed that same month for unsatisfactory research? 

These were the exact requirements given to me by the review committee:
1. before June 5, 2023, provide a 1-page write up that addresses the problem statement, hypothesis, and approaches of the thesis and give an outline of thesis chapters,
2. ﻿﻿﻿before August 30, 2023, re-do and pass a six-month review.
    
I was notified by Chenliang of the termination on July 24th, specifically that he would not support me “in the Fall”. Having no promise of funding (or an advisor), I emailed Chenliang and the committee members on August 10th to describe these events. Immediately, Chenliang replied with a lie, as well as the assertion that I could do my thesis if I just “formatted” it the way he recommended. I felt this would be a dishonest thesis, if I followed his advice, and then was terminated anyway this month due to my 6 years of research suddenly being “inconsistent.” I didn’t have enough for a thesis, in my opinion, and requested an extra year (out of 7) as well as reiterated the previously-mentioned situations, and of course the insanity of continuing to earnestly labor under an advisor who had just fired me and consciously/intentionally distorted truth. Without further discussion, they terminated me.

### October 30th - October 31st

Following this, one person in Chenliang's lab replied directly to me describing a similar experience, and asked me to convey it to the CS department chair, but didn't feel comfortable talking to the CS department chair directly about it. Despite the amorality of advisor-pressure on students to publish faster, the power structure of a grad student's employers unionizes them against the student and any public protest against that hierarchy's presumed ranges of authority is a danger to the student's status in the program, which sometimes determines many other facets of their life such as immigration status and finance situations, not to mention the PhD degree to which one's most precious years in life were invested with hard work for little pay.

Outside of the student who asked me to convey to the CS department chair that he was going through something similar, the only recipient in the CS department who replied directly wrote: "Sam - I am really sorry this happened to you" which I genuinely sincerely appreciate, but he added: "It doesn’t seem fair. Especially because we all had to deal with the BS of COVID. My advice would be to try to get out of here with minimal effort and get the PhD. Just modify the thesis in line with Chenliang’s wishes and get out of dodge man."

That's well-intentioned! I replied thankfully, but to clarify: I hadn't written a thesis to modify. They wanted me to write my whole thesis in ~1 month when I needed more time. I also went through Covid, combined with the medical trauma. He also used past tense ("happened" and "had to") when what I described was happening then, and is, at its full height at that/this present moment. Also, my thesis wasn't ever their reason for my termination. The final specified reason, coinciding with the date of my stipend being cut and after the decision to dismiss and terminate me, formally was the six-month review make-up, in the known light and context of everything, that chronologically followed after my 2nd advisor notifying me of my stipend cut and his leaving. The reason it matters is because this is 6 years of a person's life that were discarded over a bullshit reason and countless inflicted tragedies by the same unliable institution, likely connecting to other such incidents and more generalized issues by the way if you don't give a shit about me as a worker/medical patient/person. And I stood up for all of you whenever I heard of injustice. [I protested Florian Jaeger in 2017](https://www.facebook.com/sam.lerman.75/posts/pfbid022WLFEEXSzfq6mj9vogGdMW6pb5sjDYtyxzzjDBmWAv8ucHK63UumWree68bCQiBAl), [made the website](https://github.com/URGSU) for the original UR Grad Student Union effort freely and rallied people for that effort, both before those things could've mattered to me directly in any way, and even in my first year as a PhD student defended my friends against a professor on email record. I lost my hair for having eczema, I got brain damaged for being coerced against my will into taking benzodiazepine prescriptions ("GABA down-regulated hellfire" as I described in a department email), and was far and away their hardest worker probably ever.

### Hardest worker?

I did everything advised and required, amid hospitalizations and medical trauma. I exerted unthinkable discipline to stay functional during those times.

Aside from fasting, I did all of the following things for at least a year consecutively without interuption, some of these things for many years. That might sound voluntary, or unreasonable. No, I had to both to do PhD work and recover from the Medical Center's severe damages. I'm a 5'5" nerdy guy who weighs 110lb and these kinds of disciplines aren't natural to me. Medical leaves aren't paid and I could've lost the subsidization for my student loans and, I believe, health insurance. Those disciplines are the only thing that made it possible to meet the requirements of the program, while literally mutilated, brain damaged, and burning alive. Those damages were induced by the University of Rochester Medical Center's malpractices, while they profited from that med center's research (where I also worked concurrently), big-pharma drug agreements, and coercive psychoactive-drug prescriptions/administrations on me. The University of Rochester is literally a monopoly, both financially as a Rochester-wide power-center and over the thinking, consciousness, and sometimes physiology of its students and workers, with no accountability.

- Daily yoga, pranayama, and transcendental meditation
- Daily jogs and calisthenics
- Daily freezing cold ice baths
- No movies, tv shows, social media... or even music (due to a Sadghuru and friend recommendation)
- Strict diets. Paleo, Paleo-Keto, and grassfed-pasture-raised-steak-and-wildcaught-salmon-only (allowing my hair to grow back)
- Daily walks in nature
- After the benzo brain damage but before the year(s) when I did all that, prolonged fasting (8 days once and ~15 days, respectively) and intermittent fasting (for some months consecutively) as trials (got rid of my eczema more than any treatment, but bad effect in terms of cognition/perception)
- Desperate attempts to still socialize every week
- 70-hour work weeks on average, always across two labs, including usually one where I did essentially the job of a software engineer

### Email: 10/31/2023

Subject line: **Re: Supporting students**</br>
To: **Sam Lerman**</br>
From: **CS department chair**

Dear Sam,

I remain available to talk about your situation in person, now or at some point in the future, should you choose to apply for reinstatement.  Email is not an effective path toward mutual understanding.

For the record, I do not agree with your characterization of how or why you are being dropped from the program.  To complete a PhD, one must successfully defend one’s thesis before a faculty committee.  Good standing in the program requires that the committee believe, throughout one’s studies, that there is a reasonable chance for a successful defense.  That’s why we have six-month reviews.  You never scheduled a review for Fall 2022.  Your Spring 2023 review was unsuccessful  The follow-up document you wrote did not allay your committee’s concerns.  You did not schedule a make-up review.  Your committee believes you could finish fairly soon if you would heed their advice regarding the research plan, but you have declined to do so.  Given this, we see no prospect that an eventual defense would be successful.

Yours,

Michael

### Conclusive disproof

Propositions:

1. "Your Spring 2023 review was unsuccessful  The follow-up document you wrote did not allay your committee’s concerns."
2. "You did not schedule a make-up review."
3. "Your committee believes you could finish fairly soon if you would heed their advice regarding the research plan, but you have declined to do so."

#

1. **"Your Spring 2023 review was unsuccessful  The follow-up document you wrote did not allay your committee’s concerns."**

Chris Kanan is the only committee member who specified concerns. 

Chris Kanan suggested I innovate a new reinforcement learning systems algorithm. That in itself is a huge suggestion. [Here](https://github.com/slerman12/Builder/commit/e8b896c75bdeb388995af912a25108dfa16a92f9) is the commit in which I innovated a new reinforcement learning systems algorithm, just prior to the July 24th date when I was notified that my stipend was going to be cut and 2nd advisor leaving.

2. **"You did not schedule a make-up review."**

The make-up review deadline was August 30th. I was notified of my stipend being cut and 2nd advisor leaving on July, 24th. July, 24th precedes August 30th. See [here](https://github.com/slerman12/Detective-Sam/blob/main/7-Ongoing.md).

3. **"Your committee believes you could finish fairly soon if you would heed their advice regarding the research plan, but you have declined to do so."**

Chris Kanan suggested I innovate a new reinforcement learning systems algorithm. That in itself is a huge suggestion. Other than that, no other concrete research plan advice was provided. [Here](https://github.com/slerman12/Builder/commit/e8b896c75bdeb388995af912a25108dfa16a92f9) is the commit in which I innovated a new reinforcement learning systems algorithm, just prior to the July 24th date when I was notified that my stipend was going to be cut and 2nd advisor leaving.

Can edit to: [Here](https://github.com/AGI-init/UnifiedML/blob/ef14f7ff14b0b494d14bc8ee4bfe8925ad2a1fb3/ML/World/Replay.py#L566-L607) is the accelerated and parallelized sampling without replacement for RL algorithm with adaptive, truly-shared RAM memory, memory-mapping, and dynamically growing Replay storage, and [here](https://github.com/slerman12/Builder/commit/e8b896c75bdeb388995af912a25108dfa16a92f9) is one of the commits as I finished implementing it, just prior to the July 24th date when I was notified that my stipend was going to be cut and 2nd advisor leaving.

### Additional context 

(editing)

The decision to cut my stipend (salary) occurred arbitrarily, long before the formality they ultimately used to justify the termination. This decision also followed two of my advisors and most of my committee members leaving, arbitrarily and in no way caused by me, and almost all of the deliberations were made entirely by people who literally had never met me during my 10 years there. I had to switch advisors in my 3rd year (of my PhD program) because my original advisor Henry Kautz was promoted to lead the AI division at the NSF. I switched to Chenliang Xu, who also decided to leave after 3 years due to me not having as many papers as he considered standard, despite my publication rate being about the same as or better than my original advisor’s average doctoral student (I published 2 papers in those 3 years under Chenliang, one in a top venue). Besides what should be considered a perfectly reasonable publication rate, they had extreme evidence of my research [talent](https://github.com/slerman12/Help-me/blob/main/5-Early-work-in-program.md) and [skill](https://github.com/slerman12/Detective-Sam/blob/main/6-Indebted.md). From successfully innovating on the methods behind ChatGPT 5 years ago before anyone outside of a small niche handful of researchers heard of MHDPA to predicting and painstakingly teaching the professors at my university about every recent and impending research innovation, with my predictions always proving true even when they argued or doubted. All of this got forgotten and discarded ultimately in the decision made by total strangers in my final year.

I was assigned to a lab that my advisor didn't know was related to my research, and had to program for them for funding (in addition to regular PhD work). I also wrote the ideas for their grants later and wasn't credited.

Protest my unjust firing, negotiate for the dignity of graduate employees (higher pay, basic healthcare including vision and dental, on-campus parking, resuming the pre-Trump W2 tax statement form status), and bring back to spotlight the student loan debt cancellation plan that was passed, then unconstitutionally shut down by the Republican-dominated Supreme Court.

[Around $3 billion](https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&rls=en&q=university+of+rochester+budget&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8) is U of R's yearly budget. They're a city-wide monopoly.

The budgets and surpluses at other universities are also extreme. For example, [this](https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2022/10/14/harvard-budget-fy22/) is almost enough to cancel most of Harvard's students' debt, ever. Let me stress that. The budgetary surplus of a single year. *All* of Harvard's students' debt this year. Most of Harvard's students' debt, ever. From a one-year surplus. For every student. Enough surplus to cancel nearly all debt for every student that ever went to Harvard, ever, from a one year's *surplus*. Universities in the US make huge profits and, with public pressure, can use that money where the Supreme Court failed. 

This hasn't been suggested elsewhere: a worker and public led pressure campaign, like the kind led against the University of Rochester 7 years ago, but on university financial policy. Orchestrated with grad workers, faculty, students, and public, to reduce tuition costs and cancel student debt.

Generally speaking these are some of the political/social figures I like: Bernie, Krystal Ball, Kyle Kulinski, ShoeOnHead (June Nicole Lapine), Russell Brand, and Sadhguru.

## Aftermath (October 30th - October 31st)

(editing)

It turned out they weren't aware of that last point (point number 2, technically missing the 6-month review make-up by this point) until I brought it up. They ended up using it as their sole justifying reason on October 31st at 12:36 PM, the day that my worker/student status was formally cut, without prior mention of that six-month review make-up, at/between the time of my termination and this point. This email gave them their *ultimate reason for terminating me, and it chronologically followed after I was fired.* Six-month reviews are informal and meant to help students.

Following this, one person in Chenliang's lab replied directly to me describing a similar experience, and asked me to convey it to the CS chair. 

The administrators changed their reason for terminating me multiple times before landing on the make-up review.

> Your committee believes you could finish fairly soon if you would heed their advice regarding the research plan, but you have declined to do so.

I didn't decline their research plan and they didn’t provide one. Chenliang only vaguely and last-minute suggested I adhere to his formatting instructions. One of the committee members explicitly realized [on email record](https://github.com/slerman12/Help-me/blob/main/4-Faith.md) that he didn't even remember me. My committee was new, due to my previous committee members leaving or not being available for reasons that had nothing to do with me. The University had no evidence for any of its changing set of reasons for terminating me.

There’s a difficult-to-state hypocrisy about the University of Rochester being the ones to terminate me. Florian Jaeger’s termination was called for by the entire student body (including me actually, [publicly](https://www.facebook.com/sam.lerman.75/posts/pfbid022WLFEEXSzfq6mj9vogGdMW6pb5sjDYtyxzzjDBmWAv8ucHK63UumWree68bCQiBAl)) and soon the entire media and nation. The scandal sensationalized to national prominence, the University spent millions of dollars in defense of, well, evidence-based termination I guess, and then ultimately fired a dean and not that professor.

Here is an excerpt from how I replied, immediately after their email, on that last and final day:

> Please provide evidence of research (not thesis-formatting) advice that was provided and not followed.

None of them replied, since I guess it was my final day.

### Additional context

Note: the decision to cut off my funding occurred arbitrarily, before the formality they ultimately used to justify the termination. This decision also followed two of my advisors and most of my committee members leaving, arbitrarily and in no way related to me, and almost all of the deliberations were made entirely by people who literally had never met me during my 10 years there. I had to switch advisors in my 3rd year (of my PhD program) because my original advisor Henry Kautz was promoted to lead the AI division at the NSF. I switched to Chenliang Xu, who also decided to leave after 3 years due to me not having as many papers as he considered standard, despite my publication rate being about the same as or better than my original advisor’s average doctoral student (I published 2 papers in those 3 years under Chenliang, one in a top venue). Besides what should be considered a perfectly reasonable publication rate, they had extreme evidence of my research [talent](https://github.com/slerman12/Help-me/blob/main/5-Early-work-in-program.md) and [skill](https://github.com/slerman12/Detective-Sam/blob/main/6-Indebted.md). From successfully innovating on the methods behind ChatGPT 5 years ago before anyone outside of a small niche handful of researchers heard of MHDPA to predicting and painstakingly teaching the professors at my university about every recent and impending research innovation, with my predictions always proving true even when they argued or doubted. All of this got forgotten and discarded ultimately in the decision made by total strangers in my final year.

I painstakingly/excruciatingly obeyed everything they required or advised me to do for the last 6 years, amid hospitalizations and medical trauma. I also exerted unthinkable discipline to stay functional during those times, including daily transcendental meditation; daily yoga; daily freezing cold ice baths; no movies, tv shows, social media, or even music (due to a Sadghuru and friend recommendation); strict diet, including Paleo, Paleo-Keto, and grassfed-pasture-raised-steak-and-wildcaught-salmon-only (allowing my hair to grow back at one point); daily walks in nature; 70-hour work weeks; at different points, after the benzo brain damage but before the year(s) when I did all that, prolonged fasting (8 days once and ~15 days, respectively) and intermittent fasting (for some months consecutively) as trials (got rid of my eczema more than any treatment, but bad effect in terms of cognition/perception); and desperate attempts to still socialize every week. For more than a year, some of these things for many years. So I had to compensate for the Medical Center's damages in extreme ways, since the damages were extremely severe to my entire wellbeing, appearance, and cognition including social. If I took a medical leave, during the worst of the physical damage (following hair loss, and brain damage), I would have lost the subsidization for my student loans, salary, and health insurance. Those disciplines are the only thing that made it possible to meet the requirements of the PhD program, while literally brain damaged no less. I'm a 5'5" guy who weighs 110lb. Those damages were induced by the University of Rochester Medical Center's malpractices, something not even weighed into the University of Rochester's decision whether or not to terminate me while they profited from that med center's research (where I also worked concurrently by the way), big-pharma drug agreements, and coercive psychoactive-drug prescriptions/administrations on me. The University of Rochester is literally a monopoly, both financially as a Rochester-wide power-center and over the thinking, consciousness, and sometimes physiology of its students and workers, with no accountability.

I was assigned to a lab that my advisor didn't know was related to my research, and had to program for them for funding (in addition to regular PhD work). I also wrote the ideas for their grants later and wasn't credited.

### Extreme suffering

> Elaborating on "blood oozing / flesh-ripping", and this is only 2/5 of what I listed in the first email and probably the least of the trauma involving the University of Rochester Medical Center, where I also (independent from treatment) had to work and for a time, literally clock-in.

Some phenomena of experience are so radically different in their experience than the common portrayal. The best example I can think of is full body head-to-toe eczema. 

Eczema, unlike other torturous conditions, is often described in the context of kids as being this benign disturbance that is, perhaps, imagined in the clinical setting, like at a doctor’s checkup. 

The reality is, imagine yourself crawled up in a tight shrug of arms and legs, unable to walk or stretch or move, with head to toe in a constant itching bleeding sensation. Scars, raw disturbing blood leaking wet with white pus as you walk like a lynchworm just to get to the bathroom. And then the water. The scathing fire of water on your skin every morning just so you can get to work. Not school — not elementary school — not college — but grown-up adult work. 

And this is indescribable, the torture. Unimaginable, except that you would not wish it on yourself. 

Henry once said to me “you look terrible” and I appreciate the observation. 

I appreciate the noticing of just how unspeakable and hard-to-understand the torture is, but sometimes it’s visible and more often than not it’s not, at least in plain sight, everyday. 

Henry was a good advisor. We argued, but I don’t blame him. However, I was right about multi-head dot-product attention. 

This was, maybe, just before I lost all of my hair, eyebrows, and eyelashes due to the prescription and mishandling of a biologic agent Dupilumab for my eczema.

I hope this is understood. 1 malpractice, followed by many more. I am now bald.

Note: finding [this note from myself](https://www.facebook.com/sam.lerman.75/posts/pfbid022WLFEEXSzfq6mj9vogGdMW6pb5sjDYtyxzzjDBmWAv8ucHK63UumWree68bCQiBAl) (in 2017, condemning the university's actions around Florian Jaeger) actually stopped me from a suicide since, after sending out all of these emails, nobody except my mom and a small handful of friends (mostly living far away) supported me. 

I want to emphasize this. I was going to commit suicide. Support from myself 7 years ago is the only thing that prevented it.

The only person in the CS department, outside of one student from Chenliang's lab (the one who — honestly, quite bravely — asked me to convey to the CS chair that he was going through something similar), and aside from two of my already-graduated friends (including a former student in Chenliang's lab), who replied directly, wrote: "Sam - I am really sorry this happened to you" which I genuinely sincerely appreciate, but he added: "It doesn’t seem fair. Especially because we all had to deal with the BS of COVID. My advice would be to try to get out of here with minimal effort and get the PhD. Just modify the thesis in line with Chenliang’s wishes and get out of dodge man."

That's well-intentioned! I replied thankfully, but to clarify: I hadn't written a thesis to modify. They wanted me to write my whole thesis in ~1 month when I needed more time. And, no, sorry, I also went through Covid and those years were a respite for me compared to the rest of the aforementioned and not-mentioned medical trauma that I had, combined with the ongoing/over-looming injustice of all of this. He also used past tense "happened" and "had to" when what I described was happening then, and is, at its full height at that/this present moment. Also, my thesis wasn't ever their reason for my termination. The final one, coinciding with the date of my stipend being cut and after the decision to dismiss and terminate me, formally was only the six-month review, in the known light and context of everything. The reason it matters is because this is 6 years of a person's life that were discarded over a bullshit six-month review and countless inflicted tragedies by the same unliable institution, likely connecting to other such incidents and more generalized issues by the way if you don't give a shit about me as a worker/medical patient/person. And I stood up for all of you whenever I heard of injustice. I protested Florian Jaeger, made the website for the original UR Grad Student Union effort freely, rallied people to unionize before it could've mattered to me directly in any way, and defended my friends on email record even against a professor. I lost my hair for having eczema, I got brain damaged for being coerced against my will into taking benzodiazepine prescriptions ("GABA down-regulated hellfire" as I described), I was literally abused inside those rooms, and I met every reasonable standard and then some as a worker.

## Sincerely calling on the public

If you’re an undergrad, master’s, or PhD student, or university faculty interested in labor-reform: [Grads Alliance](https://www.facebook.com/groups/1600564167019335/). Join this group and protest my unjust firing, negotiate for the dignity of graduate employees (higher pay, basic healthcare including vision and dental, on-campus parking, resuming the pre-Trump W2 tax statement form status), and bring back to spotlight the student loan debt cancellation plan that was passed, then unconstitutionally shut down by the Republican-dominated Supreme Court.

### ...and expanding scope... for those who care about more than one issue at a time

[Around $3 billion](https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&rls=en&q=university+of+rochester+budget&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8) is U of R's yearly budget. They're a city-wide monopoly.

The budgets and surpluses at other universities are also extreme. For example, [this](https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2022/10/14/harvard-budget-fy22/) is almost enough to cancel most of Harvard's students' debt, ever. Let me stress that. The budgetary surplus of a single year. *All* of Harvard's students' debt this year. Most of Harvard's students' debt, ever. From a one-year surplus. For every student. Enough surplus to cancel nearly all debt for every student that ever went to Harvard, ever, from a one year's *surplus*.

I can and/or can't run this, and will largely leave it as a platform for democratized discussion and planning. And am happy to give it to, say, Bernie Sanders and Our Revolution, if it amasses success. Generally speaking these are some of the political/social figures I like: Bernie, Krystal Ball, Kyle Kulinski, ShoeOnHead (June Nicole Lapine), Russell Brand, and Sadhguru. If that doesn't bother you, then consider [joining](https://www.facebook.com/groups/1600564167019335/), and comfortably planning the end of student debt.

If enough people (especially faculty, grads, and students) give a shit, universities have no choice.
