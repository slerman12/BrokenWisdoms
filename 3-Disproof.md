Subject line: **Supporting students**</br>
To: **CS grad department**</br>
From: **CS department chair**

Dear colleagues,

As members of the department’s many email lists, you may have received a note this afternoon raising questions about the experience of a graduate student.  While I cannot comment on any specific case, the faculty, staff, and administrators of the CS Department and the Hajim School remain (and have been) committed to fostering a just and supportive environment, and to following our stated policies, as outlined in the [URCS PhD handbook](https://www.cs.rochester.edu/assets/pdf/phd-handbooks/2023-v2_4-25-23_phd-handbook.pdf), the [UR Graduate Handbook](https://www.rochester.edu/college/gradstudies/graduate-handbook//index.html), and our broader [Vision and Values](https://www.rochester.edu/college/odos/meliora-vision-values/index.html).

If you have any concerns, please feel free to reach out.
 
Yours,
 
Michael L. Scott (he/him)</br>

### Email: 10/30/2023

Subject line: **Re: [Grads] Supporting students**</br>
To: **CS grad department students**</br>
From: **Sam Lerman**

Michael, can you clarify where in the PhD handbook it says that a student with two publications (one pending) may be dismissed, last-minute and without prior warning, for “not enough papers” in their 6th year? In the middle of a paper-review response, by the way. Pending, with positive reviews. And having had no begrudging or otherwise “tacit” negative relationship with their advisor. Purely on that reason: “not enough papers”.

I know the reason was later modified to assert that my research over 6 years hasn’t been consistent. It has, with 2.5 hrs of weekly lab/group meetings with my advisor to ensure that it has, but the assertion itself was based on a 20-minute zoom meeting with a brand new committee.

Can I ask where in the PhD handbook it says that, if at the last minute a student’s committee members and/or advisor leave/get promoted/retire, that regardless of whether the student was notified in advance, that the computer science department would not in any way be responsible for sudden unwarned departures, and that the last-minute new committee’s opinions would be held as absolute? A committee whose advice following our one and only meeting was actually followed, as I reported to Chenliang on the day that he asserted that he would no longer support me in the Fall due to “not enough papers". 

Is it also permissible to ask where in the PhD handbook it says that a student in a rapidly changing tech field, is blamed for the rapid research changes that have to happen in that rapidly progressing field? The handbook should reflect accountability of the grad school for termination. That they need to give evidence, citing specific research examples, that the student over the course of their years of study, followed in opposition to advisor guidance. For example, my “UnifiedML” library, that I have been reporting on every week for about 3 years now, and is pretty much complete with novel robotics and foundation model methods equipped, was decided to be “unviable” in the very letter in which my stipend was formally terminated. How did those meetings, every week for many years, happen?

May I suggest an amendment to the PhD handbook? Perhaps it would be more fostering of justice and support if a PhD student’s research and contributions had to be weighed in the ruling about them as “inconsistent.”

May I also suggest that, if on email record the advisor is quoted as saying that the student has already done enough to successfully defend (indeed to do so as early as November, given that “you listen to my advice to format your thesis" correctly), that said student can’t in any just rationale be dismissed that same month for unsatisfactory research? 

These were the exact requirements given to me by the review committee:
1. before June 5, 2023, provide a 1-page write up that addresses the problem statement, hypothesis, and approaches of the thesis and give an outline of thesis chapters,
2.    before August 30, 2023, re-do and pass a six-month review.
    
I was notified by Chenliang of the termination on July 24th, specifically that he would not support me “in the Fall”. Having no promise of funding (or an advisor), I emailed Chenliang and the committee members on August 10th to describe these events. Immediately, Chenliang replied with a lie, as well as the assertion that I could do my thesis if I just “formatted” it the way he recommended. I felt this would be a dishonest thesis, if I followed his advice, and then was terminated anyway this month due to my 6 years of research suddenly being “inconsistent.” I didn’t have enough for a thesis, in my opinion, and requested an extra year (out of 7) as well as reiterated the previously-mentioned situations, and of course the insanity of continuing to earnestly labor under an advisor who had just fired me and consciously/intentionally distorted truth. Without further discussion, they terminated me.

#

### 10/30/2023 - 10/31/2023, and 7 years ago - now

Following this, one person in Chenliang's lab replied directly to me describing a similar experience, and asked me to convey it to the CS department chair, but didn't feel comfortable talking to the CS department chair directly about it. Despite the amorality of advisor-pressure on students to publish faster, the power structure of a grad student's employers unionizes them against the student and any public protest against that hierarchy's presumed ranges of authority is a danger to the student's status in the program, which sometimes determines many other facets of their life such as immigration status and finance situations, not to mention the PhD degree to which one's most precious years in life were invested with hard work for little pay.

Outside of the student who asked me to convey to the CS department chair that he was going through something similar, the only recipient in the CS department who replied directly wrote: "Sam - I am really sorry this happened to you" which I genuinely sincerely appreciate, but he added: "It doesn’t seem fair. Especially because we all had to deal with the BS of COVID. My advice would be to try to get out of here with minimal effort and get the PhD. Just modify the thesis in line with Chenliang’s wishes and get out of dodge man."

That's well-intentioned! I replied thankfully, but to clarify: I hadn't written a thesis to modify. They wanted me to write my whole thesis in ~1 month when I needed more time. I also went through Covid, following and concurrent with all the medical traumas I went through. He also used past tense ("happened" and "had to") when what I described was happening then, and is, at its full height at that/this present moment. Also, my thesis wasn't ever their reason for my termination. The final specified reason, on 10/31/2023 after the decision to dismiss and terminate me, was (eventually) formally the six-month review make-up, in the known light and context of everything, that chronologically followed after notifying me of my stipend cut and 2nd advisor leaving and giving multiple provably false reasons. The reason it matters is because this is 6 years of a person's life that were discarded over a bullshit reason and countless inflicted tragedies by the same liable institution, pointing to more generalized problems for workers/medical patients/people. I stood up for students when I heard of injustice. [I protested Florian Jaeger in 2017](https://www.facebook.com/sam.lerman.75/posts/pfbid022WLFEEXSzfq6mj9vogGdMW6pb5sjDYtyxzzjDBmWAv8ucHK63UumWree68bCQiBAl), [made the website for the original UR Grad Student Union effort](https://github.com/URGSU) freely, rallied people for that effort before unionization could've uniquely helped me as much as it could now, and in my first year as a PhD student defended three other grads on email record against a shared professor's project-related mistreatment of one of them. I lost my hair for having eczema, I got brain damaged for being coerced against my will into taking benzodiazepines ("GABA down-regulated hellfire" as I described), and was far and away their hardest worker probably ever.

### Hardest worker - literally.

I did everything advised and required, amid hospitalizations, medical trauma, and between bouts of severe eczema. I exerted unthinkable discipline to stay functional during those times.

Aside from fasting for the sake of my eczema, I did all of the following listed disciplines for at least a year consecutively without interruption concurrently, some of these things for many years. That might sound voluntary, or unreasonable. No, I had to both to do PhD work and to recover from the Medical Center's severe damages. I'm a 5'5" nerdy guy who weighs 110lb and these kinds of disciplines aren't natural to me. Medical leaves aren't paid and I could've lost the subsidization for my student loans and potentially health insurance. Those disciplines are the only thing that made it possible to meet the requirements of the program, while literally mutilated, brain damaged, and burning alive. Those damages were induced by the University of Rochester Medical Center's malpractices, while they profited from that Med Center's research (where I also worked concurrently), big-pharma drug agreements, and coercive psychoactive-drug prescriptions/administrations on me. The University of Rochester is literally a monopoly, both financially as a Rochester-wide power-center and over the health of its students and workers.

- Daily yoga, pranayama, and twice-daily [Transcendental Meditation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Across_the_Universe#Composition)
- Daily jogs and calisthenics
- Daily freezing cold ice baths
- No movies, tv shows, social media... or even music (due to a Sadghuru and friend recommendation)
- Paleo diet at the start of the program. After damages, Paleo-Keto, and then most effectively, "all-steak", but more specifically, organic grassfed grass-finished pasture-raised steak, Himalayan sea salt, and wild-caught salmon only (allowing my hair to grow back). TO DO: Point out how expensive this was on less than a living wage for a student with no financial safety net, a family that immigrated here without money as refugees (including me), and that New York State officially classifies the University of Rochester's salary for PhD students as being below official living wage. Noting again: three times my hair grew back on this diet, and it very noticeably expedited my brain damage recovery, and those were the reasons I had to do it (besides one of my friends biasing me more towards meat).
- Daily walks in nature
- Desperate attempts to still socialize every week
- 70-hour work weeks on average, always across two labs, including usually ones where I did essentially the job of a software engineer minus the pay
- After the benzo brain damage but before the year(s) when I did all that, prolonged fasting (8 days and ~15 days, respectively, in that time period at least) and intermittent fasting (16:8, for maybe about one consecutive month) as trials (prolonged fasting gets rid of my eczema, but sometimes bad effect in terms of cognition/perception; intermittent fasting hasn't helped me), as well as prolonged fasts for religious observances such as Yom Kippur.

Also, if you need evidence of my hard work, just look at my GitHubs and GitHub repositories and commit counts and even chronologies and time stamps if you really want to investigate the extent of it.

For a small idea, see these [slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ZQFeiOKSU2teVGg5EHlgREAi8pJY_Mr1CJ3H2pfFBfI/edit?usp=sharing).

### My termination had nothing to do with my work

The decision to cut off my funding occurred arbitrarily, before the formality they ultimately used to justify the termination. This decision also followed two of my advisors and most of my committee members leaving, arbitrarily and in no way related to me, and almost all of the deliberations were made entirely by people who literally had never met me during my 10 years in undergrad or PhD. I had to switch advisors in my 3rd year (of my PhD) because my original advisor Henry Kautz was promoted to lead the AI division at the NSF. I switched to Chenliang Xu, who also decided to leave after 3 years due to me not having as many papers as he considered standard, despite my publication rate being about the same as or better than my original advisor’s average doctoral student (I [published 2 papers in the 3 years under Chenliang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=3xy30K0AAAAJ&hl=en), [one in a top venue](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.08601)). Besides what should be considered a perfectly reasonable publication rate, they had extreme evidence of my research [talent](https://github.com/slerman12/BrokenWisdoms/blob/main/5-Early-work-in-program.md) and [skill](https://github.com/slerman12/BrokenWisdoms/blob/main/6-Indebted.md). From successfully innovating on the methods behind ChatGPT 5 years ago before anyone outside of a small niche handful of researchers heard of MHDPA to predicting and painstakingly teaching the professors at my university about every recent and impending research innovation that developed in deep learning during (and after) my fascination in those areas during my PhD, with my predictions always proving true even when those advisors and faculty argued or doubted. All of this got forgotten and discarded ultimately in the decision made by total strangers in my final year.

Prior to all of that, I was assigned to a lab that my advisor didn't know was related to my research, and had to program for them for funding (in addition to regular PhD work). I also wrote the ideas for their grants later and wasn't credited.

### Hypocrisy

The University gave false reasons for why they were terminating me, and didn't care about evidence.

There’s a difficult-to-state hypocrisy about the University of Rochester being the ones to terminate me. Professor Florian Jaeger’s termination was called for by the entire student body, [and me](https://www.facebook.com/sam.lerman.75/posts/pfbid022WLFEEXSzfq6mj9vogGdMW6pb5sjDYtyxzzjDBmWAv8ucHK63UumWree68bCQiBAl)). The scandal sensationalized to national prominence, the University spent millions of dollars in defense of, well, evidence-based termination I guess, and then ultimately a dean resigned and not that professor.

After this 10/30/2023 email, replying to the false accusation of "declining to follow research advice", I said:

> "Please provide evidence of research (not thesis-formatting) advice that was provided and not followed."

None of them provided any evidence of anything, or replied for that matter. They made an exceptionally untrue accusation. It's not even funny how much I followed research advice and did what I was told.

Another point of their hypocrisy is that their concluding termination reason was, as their last recourse of justification, that I "skipped" a make-up review, from a committee where every single one of my advisors and most of my committee members had previously skipped or altogether left without notice or warning.

### You should probably protest

Protest my unjust firing, negotiate for the dignity of graduate employees (higher pay, basic healthcare including vision and dental, on-campus parking, resuming the pre-Trump W2 tax statement form status), and bring back to spotlight the student loan debt cancellation plan that was passed, then unconstitutionally shut down by the Republican-dominated Supreme Court.

[Around $3 billion](https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&rls=en&q=university+of+rochester+budget&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8) is U of R's yearly budget. They're a city-wide monopoly. The budgets and surpluses at other universities are also extreme. For example, [this](https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2022/10/14/harvard-budget-fy22/) is almost enough to cancel most of Harvard's students' debt, ever. Let me stress that. The budgetary surplus of a single year. *All* of Harvard's students' debt this year. Most of Harvard's students' debt, ever. From a one-year surplus. For every student. Enough surplus to cancel nearly all debt for every student that ever went to Harvard, ever, from a one year's *surplus*. Universities in the US make huge profits and, with public pressure, can use that money where the Supreme Court failed. 

This hasn't been suggested elsewhere: a worker and public led pressure campaign, like the kind led against the University of Rochester 7 years ago, but on university financial policy. Orchestrated with grad workers, faculty, students, and public, to reduce tuition costs and cancel student debt.

Generally speaking these are some of the political/social figures I like: Bernie, Krystal Ball, Kyle Kulinski, ShoeOnHead (June Nicole Lapine), and Sadhguru.

### Slavery or impossible

1. PhD students are employees
2. Employees are not slaves
3. Slaves are involuntary workers whose work has not yet been paid for - it can be paid for later via reparations
4. To pay for full-time work requires a living wage
5. University of Rochester’s PhD student stipend is below New York State’s official living wage
6. Voluntary vs. involuntary is evidenced by what people would choose to do without guarantee of pay
7. Terminating somebody for avoiding slavery is illegal, since slavery is illegal

The demand put on me was more excessive than this summarizes since I was expected to:

1. Find yet another advisor
   - Finding a new advisor is hard. The amount of work I had to do to get into Chenliang's group spanned a long time, I had to work for free under him, and had to submit a top-venue conference paper by the end of the first summer, while in the middle of recovering from the benzo-brain damage and chemical waterboarding torture. So I already had to find a new advisor once in my 3rd year, and had to suddenly again in my 6th year, it was already proven to be an enormous and very-likely-unpaid work to do so, and both advisors bailed for reasons that were their own fault.
3. Find new source of funding
4. Re-take a six-month review
5. Do my thesis (since my advisor and PI both said I was ready, even though I said I wasn't), or:
6. According to the six-month reviewers, effectively restart my entire thesis
7. Send the department my research plan by 10/06/2023, now an added independent requirement to the previously specified six-month review requirements
   - Which I did, and when I sent it by **10/06/2023**, this was the only reply I got, of **10/12/2023**:

> Dear Sam:
>
> Thank you for your note of 6 Oct.  I have conferred with members of your committee.  They confirm that the plan you outline is neither consistent with what you originally proposed for the PhD nor a viable path to completion of the degree.  With regret, we will be terminating your student status and stipend as of the end of October.
>
> Yours,
> 
> Michael L. Scott (he/him) </br>
> Arthur Gould Yates Professor and Chair</br>
> Computer Science Department, University of Rochester</br>
> \<provided contact info redacted\>

7. Develop a brand new research plan
8. All of this on behalf of a brand new committee, people I don't know who never knew my research during my PhD prior to our one and only meeting
10. All of this amid induced health issues and in my sixth year
11. For less than New York State's legal living wage
12. Within a one to few month timeframe
13. No extensions unless all of this first
14. Under the pressure that failing to do all of this will result in termination for no substantive reason other than failing to do all of this

That's not even slavery, it's humanly impossible.

The PhD student handbook has one clause of accountability for the grad school, and it's to specify what the PhD student would need to do (without pay or support) for reinstatement, and to specify that "in writing" (as distinct from in person) when support is withdrawn. "All of the above" is as much of an answer as they gave me, but, technically speaking, they haven't given me an answer on that and [are currently ghosting me](https://github.com/slerman12/BrokenWisdoms/blob/main/7-Ongoing.md).

This is simultaneously slavery, humanly impossible, and fascism all wrapped into one.

### Why it's fascism

The medical and learning systems of the University of Rochester have disproven large parts of themselves. But the learning system of the University of Rochester has proven something: that they are fascist. I don't mean to invoke Godwin's law here. This isn't exaggeration or hyperbole, but in a moment will be a proof, as much as there can be, that they are fascist. By themselves, these policies might not seem like fascism. Agglomerated, the University of Rochester has ran fascism above their claimed vision, values, and principles.

When my first advisor left, my second advisor Chenliang made me do insanely high-pressure work without paying me because that was the condition on which to get into his lab as was required to stay in the program, and as my withdrawing advisor directed me, in my 3rd year already in the program, while I worked at the Medical Center. I had to come up with, write, run the experiments for, and submit a new publishable paper to a top-venue conference in a short and implausible amount of time as the sudden condition for my stay in the program, having done nothing wrong and even having been ahead of the curve on the ChatGPT methods 5 years before ChatGPT despite their disagreements and doubts. Chenliang proved how hard it was to switch advisors. And now they wanted me to repeat that in my 6th year.

I was expected to do that while answering for the new 6-month review brand new committee, brand new because multiple committee members and an advisor left with little warning and no accountability, as well as this second advisor. 

I was expected to do all that while I still held onto my pay of less than the living wage in my state, and I obeyed — I even implemented the novel systems-level RL algorithm that was suggested by one of the brand new committee members, the only provided suggestion from any of them. That's a Hell of a lot of engineering work for no reason, and not the first time I had to do 6-figure salary work at the behest of departments across the University of Rochester, from the uncredited work at the Medical Center to the XRD neural modeling, distracting from my own proposed plans of research and requirements set on me.

My 6th-year advisor decided to leave. So I suggested two faculty, asked one personally, and emailed four others, and was rejected or ignored. 

The threat meanwhile is that if the demands, often unspecified, aren't met, 6 years of life will be wasted. All the money that could've been made trusting some other institution or working elsewhere — instead, less than minimum wage. Instead, serving their demands — usually engineering work, not research — always took priority — spit on — so what if it benefited them and not me. And all the life experiences that were missed — 6 years — for the sake of indenturement and trauma — collateral damage. 

The demands were not reasonable, and in agglomeration inhumane — gavels slammed without just cause just because the independent pieces of policy vaguely gave and give the judges the power to.

They cherrypick the policies, vision, and values (e.g., "bad standing" in department), but instead of doing so with the purpose of creating love (e.g., helping find a new advisor), they do so without thought or empathy to what's at stake for them (e.g., the high stake of their billion-dollar institution getting to pay less than New York State's living wage) vs. what's at stake for someone else (e.g., losing at least 6 years of his life undeservedly despite good, hard work after enormous injustice without them addressing their own inflictions of injustice), what will have to be done by them (e.g., not making a termination decision), and what will have to be done by the person ruled on (e.g., the 13 items listed above). They are bad rulers (e.g., aforementioned and elaborated on practices). And promote the policy of fascism when any ambiguity lets them, e.g.: They promote greed (e.g., saving money by not paying an employee and justifying it by "not enough papers") and efficiency over humanity (e.g., rushing paper publications even at the expense of safety and publication quality) and self-serving decisions (e.g., sabbaticals and promotions over responsibilities to students and employees) and impartial rulings (e.g., by a 6-month review from a brand new committee) when reward or laziness is at stake (e.g., no calling on witnesses or cross-referencing of accusations) and hypocritically (e.g., demanding evidence with respect to the accusations against Florian Jaegar and in deciding not to terminate him and offering none themselves to defend the reasons they gave in the termination of me when terminating me had no justification). Meanwhile, they are literally a city-wide monopoly, unaccounted for and unchecked. Greed is the root of economic domination, self-serving decisions are the root of systematized nationalism and ethnocentrism, and impartial rulings are the root of blind loyalty to systems. Those roots, in combination with hypocritical rulership, unchecked power, and prioritization of efficiency over principles and humanity (not to mention mutilation and coercive chemical measures of torture) sufficiently meet the definition of fascism in my opinion, though I am not a PhD in political philosophy. 

### Email: 10/31/2023

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The PhD student handbook has **only one clause of accountability** for the grad school, and it's to specify what the PhD student would need to do (without pay or support) for reinstatement:
> - in writing
> - when support is withdrawn

In the email shown below, the possibility of reinstatement was mentioned, but no details were given how, on what conditions, and whether any advisor or source of income would be provided, and if not, how to go about obtaining those without any further connections or resources to do so. Having emailed the individual faculty members who might have served as replacements, and met with one and suggested another to the department, there wasn't a path (and none of these things were suggested by the faculty in writing).

Also, I replied to this email below when it was sent, that is, on my last day of being an employed grad student, [asking for evidence for one of the termination reasons](#hypocrisy) and my reply was ignored. It was the last message sent between us, after [the ones above](#email-10272023) and prior to [these ones](https://github.com/slerman12/BrokenWisdoms/blob/main/7-Ongoing.md) that I resumed also currently being ignored. In that last of the ignored emails mentioned, I brought up that the reinstatement-condition wasn't indicated to me.

In this below email that Michael ignored my replies to, Michael had reached out to meet in person, but that wouldn't suffice for reinstatement nor secure my future as an employee with a salary, advisor, and a basic standard of living. The reason for wanting to meet was "mutual understanding." The reinstatement-clause explicitly specifies "in writing."

It's taking me a year to write this. "Mutual understanding" requires a book's-worth of traumatic context, that according to Michael, would somehow be better conveyable off-the-record via a meeting while I had no salary or income to an authority in a threatening position, who ignored my replies, hid away from my emailed questions, and disrespected me via a [sudden termination email on **10/12/2024**](#slavery-or-impossible) immediately following sending him my sincere research proposal that his previous email specified as the condition for staying in the program (of research that I'd already done, and according to two PIs and former advisor was ready to defend)... and the idea of "proposing" a research "plan" in one's 6th year — already having done the substance of the PhD — is ridiculous, not to mention my advisor's only caveat to graduation being that I follow his formatting instructions, ridiculous in itself since I hadn't started writing the thesis yet. I just needed more time to write the thesis. In addition to his disrespect of me, Michael didn't approve simply giving me more time due to contradictory opinions from a brand new committee, despite everything that was communicated and verified to him by email, such as my advisor's opinion that I was ready to defend, the confirmation that my advisor was leaving (second advisor to do so, and again for no particular reason), Chris Kanan's forgetting of details about the meeting ("[Deus Ex Memory](https://github.com/slerman12/BrokenWisdoms/blob/Ancillary/Deus-Ex-Memory.md)"), and all of the [aforementioned trauma](https://github.com/slerman12/BrokenWisdoms/blob/main/2-Opposing-views.md) condensed as much as I could've.

I responded to Michael about meeting in person on **10/25/2024**: (1) "Hi Michael, I’d be willing to meet. But please extend my stipend through November," and (2) "I would be glad to meet in person, but I ask that you restore my stipend for the month of November. Thank you." November is my birthday actually.

To establish "in person" instead of "in writing" as having been an "implicitly" indicated reinstatement-condition requires rephrasing the reinstatement-clause, foregoing explicit formal communications, and violating ethics by demanding that I participate in an unpaid face-to-face meeting with an authority actively inflicting trauma who has no background or expertise in my field, who has no power to address the issues preventing my reinstatement (e.g. lack of advisor), as the only imaginable grounds for hypothetical reinstatement after a disrespectful, unjustified, un-evidenced termination.

Support, as distinct from pay, was withdrawn long before Michael or any faculty mentioned reinstatement, as evidenced by my second advisor's communication of withdrawal on **07/24/2024**, the [sudden termination email on **10/12/2024**](#slavery-or-impossible), and [many tortures](https://github.com/slerman12/BrokenWisdoms/blob/main/2-Opposing-views.md), including permanent ongoing ones, inflicted by Michael's institution. To reiterate, all I asked for in the research proposal that Michael slammed with a termination, was more time. That detail was the only part he specified in a later email as having an issue with.

Note also: the University of Rochester's CS department doesn't have PhD "reinstatement applications." Any appearance of the below email as indicating a reinstatement-condition is gaslighting. There's a difference between indicating, gaslighting, and mentioning — and the referent of what is mentioned is reinstatement, not a reinstatement-condition — just as there's a difference between indicating in writing and indicating in person, and, formally, one cannot be relegated as another, at least not unless the indicated condition redefines the clause from which it's necessitated, but the PhD student handbook isn't a rewritable Turing tape.

Subject line: **Re: Supporting students**</br>
To: **Sam Lerman**</br>
From: **CS department chair**

Dear Sam,

I remain available to talk about your situation in person, now or at some point in the future, should you choose to apply for reinstatement.  Email is not an effective path toward mutual understanding.

For the record, I do not agree with your characterization of how or why you are being dropped from the program.  To complete a PhD, one must successfully defend one’s thesis before a faculty committee.  Good standing in the program requires that the committee believe, throughout one’s studies, that there is a reasonable chance for a successful defense.  That’s why we have six-month reviews.  You never scheduled a review for Fall 2022.  Your Spring 2023 review was unsuccessful  The follow-up document you wrote did not allay your committee’s concerns.  You did not schedule a make-up review.  Your committee believes you could finish fairly soon if you would heed their advice regarding the research plan, but you have declined to do so.  Given this, we see no prospect that an eventual defense would be successful.

Yours,

Michael

### Conclusive disproof

Propositions:

1. "Your Spring 2023 review was unsuccessful  The follow-up document you wrote did not allay your committee’s concerns."
2. "You did not schedule a make-up review."
3. "Your committee believes you could finish fairly soon if you would heed their advice regarding the research plan, but you have declined to do so."

#

1. **"Your Spring 2023 review was unsuccessful  The follow-up document you wrote did not allay your committee’s concerns."**

Chris Kanan is the only committee member who specified concerns. 

Chris Kanan suggested I innovate a new reinforcement learning systems algorithm. That in itself is a huge suggestion. [Here](https://github.com/slerman12/Builder/commit/e8b896c75bdeb388995af912a25108dfa16a92f9) is the commit in which I innovated a new reinforcement learning systems algorithm, just prior to the July 24th date when I was notified that my stipend was going to be cut and 2nd advisor leaving.

2. **"You did not schedule a make-up review."**

The make-up review deadline was August 30th. I was notified of my stipend being cut and 2nd advisor leaving on July, 24th. July, 24th precedes August 30th. 

- Depending on whether a PhD student counts as an employee, there might be a law against mandating labor in such an instance.

[This was added post-hoc](https://github.com/slerman12/BrokenWisdoms/blob/main/7-Ongoing.md) as a termination reason on 10/31/2023 (the official termination was on 10/12/2023, with my research plan as the reason).

Throughout, the department made multiple false statements about my research and my advisor's intentions.

3. **"Your committee believes you could finish fairly soon if you would heed their advice regarding the research plan, but you have declined to do so."**

I didn't decline their research plan and they didn’t provide one. Chenliang only vaguely and last-minute suggested I adhere to his formatting instructions. 

Chris Kanan suggested I innovate a new reinforcement learning systems algorithm. That in itself is a huge suggestion. Other than that, no other concrete research plan advice was provided. [Here](https://github.com/slerman12/Builder/commit/e8b896c75bdeb388995af912a25108dfa16a92f9) is the commit in which I innovated a new reinforcement learning systems algorithm, just prior to the July 24th date when I was notified that my stipend was going to be cut and 2nd advisor leaving.
