## Archetypal Madness

I am Chenliang, Sam's advisor. He writes this with telepathic interference from Josh, Sam's friend. Together, and this is Sam speaking, we shall derive the universe. Not derivatively of course. That would require ample physical sciences background. But sufficiently well-reasonedly, with made-up words here and there. Let's begin with a less exhausting setup. "I observe." It is true, therefore it is. At any rate, fading into sleep-deprivative exhaustion as I may be, I am reluctant to say this won't work. Largely because of the intensive time and money — "minimum wage" Josh chimes in — investment that has gone into this project. Well, so be it. The whole of the universe, in one shebang. It starts with time. But time exists as a physical construct not a mathematically deduced one. So let us find an incredibly stupid place to hide it. In equivalence.

Alright. Given $A = B$, we know $A \rightarrow B$ and $B \rightarrow A$. We don't know *when* $A \rightarrow B$. Is it in $1$ deductive step $A \rightarrow_1 B$? Is it in $n$ deductive steps $A \rightarrow_n B$. From this, we get a cheap hacky way to derive something out of literally nothing.

Let us start with nothing $\emptyset$.

Don't regard it as the empty set. Don't regard it at all.

$\emptyset_0 = \emptyset_1 = \cdots$

are all nothing, with just subscripts added.

There we now have causality, constrained only to a cyclical loop between every nothing and every other nothing. e.g.

$\emptyset_0 \rightarrow \emptyset_1 \rightarrow \cdots$

$\emptyset_0 \leftarrow \emptyset_1 \leftarrow \cdots$

These nodes can connect in any number of ways and create a multi-branched graph. The ambiguities are not necessary. Let us define one such branch/construct that we can say is "Turing equivalent" and be done with it.

Cosmogenesis:

A "grammar" — or word (if we want to make Biblical allusions/puns) — that is Turing equivalent, from nothing.

Go:

How about a tape of $\emptyset_{0,i}$ and $\emptyset_{1,i}$ (zeros and ones, or yins and yangs if you want), where $i$ lets us hackily denote the position on the tape, with implications from each non-sensical bit at deductive step $n$ to each non-sensical bit at deductive step $n + 1$.

The "halt" can be cosmo-genocide, which we are not interested in solving. $\square$

#### Formally

**Definition 1.** Axiom.

$($ Axiom  $A ) \coloneqq (\exists A)$.

**Definition 2.** Definition.

$($ Definition $A \coloneqq B) \coloneqq (\exists (A \coloneqq B))$. 

**Definition 3.** Equivalence.

$($ Equivalence $A = B) \coloneqq (A \rightarrow_n B, B \rightarrow_m A, n, m \in \mathbb{N})$, where $n, m$ are deductive steps, meaning $n-1, m-1$ statements must be deduced between $A$ and $B$ and $B$ and $A$ respectively. 

Instantaneous equivalence $(A \coloneqq B) \coloneqq (A \rightarrow_1 B, B \rightarrow_1 A)$.

For example, $(A \rightarrow_2 C) \coloneqq (A \rightarrow_1 B \rightarrow_1 C)$ for some mandatory intermediary $B$.

**Definition 4.** Implication.

$($ Implication $A \rightarrow_1 B) \coloneqq (\exists A \rightarrow_1 \exists B)$.

**Definition 5.** Proof.

$($ Deduction/theorem/proof $A \rightarrow B) \coloneqq (A \rightarrow_n B) \coloneqq (\exists A \rightarrow_n \exists B)$ for some $n \in \mathbb{N}$.

**Definition 6.** Hypotheticals.

$($ Sets of anything defined... $(A, B, ...))$ $\coloneqq ((A, B, ...))$

denoted by parentheticals. 

$A$ is a single hypothetical.

**Definition 7.** Sets of existence.

$(\langle X_1, X_2, ... \rangle) \coloneqq (\exists X_1, X_2, ...)$

hypotheticals whose elements exist.

**Definition 8.** Nothing.

The empty existence set $\emptyset \coloneqq \langle \rangle$.

**Definition 9.** Nothing equivalents.

$\emptyset = \emptyset_K \forall K \subseteq \mathbb{N}$.

**Definition 10.** The universe.

$\Omega^{(0)} \coloneqq \emptyset$.

$\Omega^{(n)} \coloneqq (( \emptyset_K \vert K \subseteq \mathbb{N}; \Omega^{(0)} \rightarrow_n \emptyset_K ), \rightarrow_n)$.

$\Omega \coloneqq (\Omega^{(0)}, \Omega^{(n)})$.

$n \in \mathbb{N}$.

**Axiom 1.** Existence exists. $\langle\langle X_1, X_2, ... \rangle\rangle \coloneqq (\exists X_1, X_2, ...)$.

**Axiom 2.** Cause exists. $\exists \rightarrow$.

**Theorem 1.** Nothing exists. $\exists \emptyset$.

**Proof.**

$((), (\langle\langle\rangle\rangle \coloneqq ()))  \rightarrow (\langle\langle\rangle\rangle)$. (Axiom 1)

$(\langle\langle\rangle\rangle)  \rightarrow (\exists \langle\rangle)$. (Definition 7)

$((\emptyset \coloneqq \langle \rangle), (\exists \langle\rangle)) \rightarrow (\exists \emptyset)$. (Definition 8) $\square$

**Theorem 2.** All nothings exist. $\exists \emptyset_K \vert K \subseteq \mathbb{N}$.

**Proof.**

$((\exists \emptyset), (\emptyset = \emptyset_K \forall K \subseteq \mathbb{N})) \rightarrow (\exists \emptyset_K \vert K \subseteq \mathbb{N})$. (Theorem 1, Definition 9) $\square$

**Theorem 3.** The universe exists. $\exists \Omega$.

**Proof.**

$((\exists \emptyset), (\Omega^{(0)} \coloneqq \emptyset)) \rightarrow (\exists \Omega^{(0)})$. (Theorem 1, Definition 10)

$((\exists \emptyset_K \vert K \subseteq \mathbb{N}), (\exists \rightarrow_n)) \rightarrow \langle\langle \emptyset_K \vert K \subseteq \mathbb{N}; \Omega^{(0)} \rightarrow_n \emptyset_K \rangle, \rightarrow_n \rangle$. (Theorem 2, Axiom 2, Axiom 1)

$\langle\langle \emptyset_K \vert K \subseteq \mathbb{N}; \Omega^{(0)} \rightarrow_n \emptyset_K \rangle, \rightarrow_n \rangle \rightarrow (\exists \Omega^{(n)})$. (Definition 10)

$((\exists \Omega^{(0)}), (\exists \Omega^{(n)})) \rightarrow (\exists \Omega)$. (Definition 10) $\square$

**Theorem 4.** The universe $\Omega$ is at least a non-halting or cyclical Turing machine. 

**Proof.**

Construct a tape of binary zeroes and ones $\emptyset_{0,i}, \emptyset_{1,i}$ where $i$ denotes the position on the tape. 

$\emptyset \rightarrow_1 \emptyset_{\tau,i} \forall i \in \mathbb{N}$.

At each time step modify one bit $\emptyset_{\tau,i} \rightarrow \emptyset_{-\tau + 1,i}$. Now, complete the equivalence cycle of Definition 9 by the following limit:

$\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty} \emptyset_{\tau,i} \rightarrow_n \emptyset$. $\square$

**Theorem 5.** An almost Turing-equivalent universe (sans halting) can arise from nothing, assuming just the properties of deduction: existence of existence and cause, defining nothing as the empty set of existence.

**Proof.**

By Theorem 4. $\square$
