The idea of saying everything is one is counterintuitive to most people.

It’s like saying “fire is water.”

Therefore, below we will more or less prove that fire is water. Fire, actually, is water.

For fun. Let’s begin.

Fire is a result of compounds breaking in such a way that their fragments bond with oxygen in the air and their rupture releases a hailstorm of electrons, sharp as knives, triggering a chain reaction of more such compounds breaking up.

Those compounds are called hydrocarbons, in the case of, for example, wood. Wood is hydrocarbons. Hydrogen and carbon. Paired together in holy divorcable matrimony.

Now when you rub them together hard and long enough with enough friction, you can rupture those bonds! After all, they’re held together quite precariously by gravity and electromagnetism and all that. Squeeze ‘em hard enough and they’ll more-or-less split.

So you rub two sticks together, say, using the bow-drill method (for fire making), and you rupture those hydrocarbons into hydrogens and carbons. Now the hydrogen will bond with the oxygen (if you’re lucky), that is, in the air, and the carbon will bond with the oxygen (if you’re unlucky), and this all-around combo-reconfiguration-of-bonding<sup>TM</sup> tends to leave excess electrons that shoot off like knives into your eyes — and also potentially into other atoms and hydrocarbons. So now that emission is what you see. It’s a spark!

If enough hydrocarbons are hanging around, say you put the ember in some tinder, now those little hailstorms will trigger a chain reaction. Like knives, they’ll cut through the other hydrocarbons present, creating instability — and more shooting electrons. 

Meanwhile, those broken off hydrogens bonded to oxygen — you know what they are? Water! Water vapor technically. Steam, if you like, with its composition of oxygen and hydrogen amidst a hailstorm of electrons. That “electricy water” is fire. 

Now the carbons on the other hand can also bond with oxygen. And that creates CO2. Meanwhile, some non-combustible elements in the mix (since non-charcoal wood for example is composed combustibly of more than just hydrocarbons) create ash and, its rising form, lifted by those rising gasses and water, smoke. 

(But does that mean fire is also CO2? Depending on the composition, maybe, [though not necessarily](https://www.quora.com/Can-you-burn-something-without-producing-CO2) and [varies](https://theconversation.com/curious-kids-if-steam-contains-water-what-does-smoke-from-fire-contain-172505))

“Electriquey steam with some residue” — FIRE — in 5 words.

So fire is water? Yes, electricy water. It is possible. It’s water with some electrons flying out creating a photoelectric rainbow of red and blue and yellow in your survival-expert-tool-wielding human eyes.

That’s fire !

That swarm of electrons keeps the reaction going. It's why it feels hot and why the hydrogens and oxygens are energized to bond in the first place, where for example ordinary atmospheric hydrogen and oxygen might not, or for that matter water. Water at room temperature is pretty good at shutting those electrons down. So is CO2 for that matter.

But if the fire is hot enough, as in magnesium fires, then you need something really dry, that isn't water or CO2, like copper, to separate the reactants from the oxygen frenzying it. In that case, water can actually fuel it. Though in fires like that, water doesn't come into the picture and we're just dealing with magnesium and all the pollution needed to get it burning to such a hot degree. Unless, for example, that temperature were reached by the energy of the sun, whose hydrogens "fuse" into helium, or by the rupture of the atom e.g. uranium or plutonium as in the controlled atomic bomb power of nuclear fission, combined sometimes with fusion as in the hydrogen bomb, or man-induced fusion: via the use of deuterium ("heavy water"). That is, water with one extra neutron, whose, and I say this with caution, knife-cut can act a bit like an electron in causing some disarray, if misused — that, a far deviation from the innocent days of nature.[^1]

Unlike fission, fusion, and unrenewable energy sources, "fire" in the primitive sense of our ancestor-paleolithic days in nature, is, vaporized regular H20, with no-neutrons, water (enchanted) by the power of electrons. With residue and sustainable levels of CO2 that the trees can breathe.

That is the Null Hypothesis by which I define words. [There was a time by the way when "blue" didn't exist](https://lethbridgenewsnow.com/2021/02/09/the-curious-case-of-the-missing-color-blue/#:~:text=It%20turns%20out%20the%20color,see”%20blue%20until%20modern%20times!).
