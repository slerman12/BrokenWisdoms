> My cognitive forces that I don't think are really, fully mine always fuck up my meaning. I didn't want to make this about propaganda, but it became about propaganda. Try to see my point through the psychic forces that skew everything I try to say. The humor is intended. But my original idea, before standing to write, was everything except the "TV" idea.

Let them eat cake: Sam Lerman’s solution to Israeli-Palestinian tensions that is totally not a Trojan horse…

…And give them TVs with access to Israeli TV shows made by creative Arabs/Palestinians that are genuinely *funny and fun* or *deep and emotional* and *not propaganda*.

Distributing resources like food, water, and solar shingles for powering light and water (and TV) by remotely-piloted friendly drones with live people talking and interacting behind them and Israeli flags, means also being able to distribute information like pamphlets and Israeli books and any other material that isn’t propagandizing but shows Israeli culture in a relatable way. Like Seinfeld does for immigrants to America. And this non-propaganda culture distribution benefits from and necessitates hiring Arabs/Palestinians in Israel to make shows and lead projects and do creative things — heck, even things critical of Israel — John Stewart to Bernie Sanders level of criticism of America doesn’t make Americans less patriotic; it actually makes them more patriotic or at least more hopeful of the nation representing the nation they want to see. That’s the job of government: if rulers can use drones and distribution technologies to provide food and resources to Palestinians, instead of missiles, then this humanitarian aid is what gives them any sort of “mandate”, not missiles. And that mandate comes from choice by the people. 

Who’s gonna join Hamas or commit Jihad when they can sit home with family, with food, water, and solar shingles replenished with independent individual-controlled power by the intense sun rays of Palestine, and watch the Arab version of Israeli Seinfeld?

In the meantime, Israel can defend itself from Hamas, but it’s important to note that the priority is to take care of its own citizens/civilians and/including Palestinians. But same goes for America and the unprecedented defense budgets that go to Israel’s military indiscriminately. That recent addition of $10 billion no strings attached, not to mentioned so much of the US's military spending, could be used to alleviate medical debt or rebuild infrastructure or transition America towards green energy, etc. If we are going to give that money to Israel though, rather than giving it indiscriminately to Israel’s military, let them negotiate the logistics for how to use half of that money to deliver humanitarian aid to Palestine and the second half for supporting its own citizens and defenses. 

In short, the resolution to bridging relationships and creating a ceasefire is: humanitarian aid to Palestinian civilians (and citizens), universally but especially those who are demographically on average statistically below the global poverty line, but with Israeli flags on and perhaps Israeli personnel behind the delivery drones/airplanes, de-weaponized, of that humanitarian aid, and with Israeli Arabs and Palestinians leading the communication. 

As for cake: don’t bring them cake. Bring them healthy foods. Organic grassfed meats and pasture raised eggs, wild caught salmon, biologique fruits and vegetables, alcohol-free classy wine, and maybe cake if you must show a little love. 

There you go. End of Israeli-Palestinian conflict. 

…God will probably like that.

Note: that John Stewart to Bernie Sanders overton window is pretty radical but you might want to go to Sam Lerman levels just to prove your faith in your literal God. 

1. In all likelihood, there will be Palestinians in every community willing to distribute the food. 
2. The deliveries can be on a recurring basis, every week to every day. 
3. The logistics of getting drones into Palestine seem to have already been solved by Israel. 
4. Smart TVs would be better than antenna TVs for tactical purposes, but some Palestinians may opt to reject Israeli TV and that’s their right. Make good content, transparently not propaganda, and hope your target demo tunes in — welcome to Hollywood. Man, if only the Jews had experience controlling the media. 
5. Logistics teams can figure out any further unanswered questions. 

For marketing reasons, this plan should not be called “Let them eat cake.” It should be called “Give Sam Lerman a Nobel Peace Prize.” No, it should be called the “humanitarian acts of faith” plan. 

“And the Nobel Peace Prize goes to…”

“I want to thank the Academy!”

“…Chris Rock!”

“WHAT?” *punches in face*

I’m a Jewish leftist with sympathies for imagining a world where there are no countries, and maybe no religion too.

I know Palestine’s not “for sale”, but providing every basic right and necessity to your citizenry basically makes you its de facto ruler, by virtue of your service, not your exercise of strength. 

To earn a mandate for rulership, for governorship, that is God’s will I believe, not missiles. 

Same goes the other way. 

Nobody is an expert in war. Nobody is qualified for war. This solution is modern and commensurate to the wealth and advancement that humanity has collectively acquired, and wisdom that it has always sensed through God.
