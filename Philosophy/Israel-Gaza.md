Long before any international conflicts, humans made an alliance with a far more challenging predator than themselves: wolves.

Today, they are “man’s best friend” thanks to that allegiance that somehow transpired 40,000 years ago.

Humans achieved this by making sacrifices of food to their hungry “predators”. And gradually, those predators became allies in hunting and tribal life.

Today, their descendents are “man’s best friend”. 

Back then, we had far less resources and wealth to give out, and no language or translators with which/whom to speak ourselves to those who we considered our predators. And yet we achieved this far more unlikely alliance.

That’s what wisdom is, and perhaps one more reason for the name “wisdom teeth” given to our canine teeth.

If there is a God, He wants Israel to give food to Gazans instead of starving them. Current efforts are half-measures, amid terror. Palestinians live below the global poverty line, while Israel does not.

To be clear, I'm not comparing anybody to animals (and those ancestors held animals sacred by the way). Everyone fighting in the war, on whichever side, has this shared ancestry to the Paleolithic age. Unlike the lion-lineage of cats that came to Egypt voluntarily like ambassadors from lions, the previous Kings of the Animal Kingdom before mankind, wolves were befriended by humans directly by human action, in a miracle that can be credited to both man and nature/God/Allah. And to be the human as opposed to the dog in this analogy, is to sacrifice *more* for the other, and to be a wolf rather than a dog, is to refrain from killing and eating those you want to kill and eat, and to be a dog if you want to be a dog, is to love mankind.

Here is what Israel should do instead of war:

- Give all Israeli citizens first-class citizenry. That means: Provide high-quality organic-type food to everybody, provide housing and energy supplies to everybody, and provide basic utilities including TV, internet, and cell service to everybody.
- Be prepared to welcome Palestine into Israel if they so choose, and do so with the incentive of the same privileges.
- In the meantime, hire Arab, Palestinian, and Muslim writers in Israel to produce Arab, Palestinian, and Muslim high-quality TV content, not propaganda. Give creatives control over their projects.
- Perhaps also distribute basic necessities to Palestinians, outside of Israel, and do so proudly and take credit. It's okay to do this with Israeli flags, despite the religious connotation, as long as the basic necessities are distributed abundantly and well.
  - Ideally: high-quality organic-type food and housing and energy supplies. Hamas would be destroyed if the food delivered constituted the healthiest food possible of all, e.g., organic grassfed meats and pasture raised eggs, wild caught salmon, biologique fruits and vegetables, water, alcohol-free fresh-juice wine, and maybe cake if you must show a little love (all of what I listed is Halal and Kosher). Under Israeli flags. Energy supplies constitutes solar shingles for example.
- Extend your TV networks to Palestine and surrounding regions. Offer free TV, internet, and cell service to Palestinians and surrounding. No coercions.
- Wait as peacefully as possible.

Here is what the UN powers should do:

- Provide humanitarian aid to Palestinians and neighboring Muslims, meaning high-quality organic-type food and housing and energy supplies. In other words, get Palestine above the global poverty line.
- Help distribute TVs, internet, cell phones, and good network coverage throughout that whole region. No coercions, just free no-propaganda service.
- Make good no-propaganda content that those regions can enjoy, potentially with mixed teams of creatives. Give resources to Palestinians to make their own content.
- Stop creating quagmires with military interventions all over the Middle East.

Currently:
- About 5% of Palestinians in Gaza have been killed or wounded, most of whom (about 70%) were women and children.
- More than 200,000 housing units in Gaza have been completely destroyed and most Palestinians (~75%) in Gaza have been forced to evacuate from their homes. 

Many Jews, including my grandpa, his sister, and his mom (his father was mandatorily fighting in the warfront), fled the Nazis to Muslim nations, like Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan for refuge. My grandpa's family evacuated from Ukraine to Kazakhstan and my grandpa was later assigned to a job in Uzbekistan by the Soviet Union to work at a leather plant/factory in Samarkand producing leather from sheepskin fur. He was a leather technology engineer there. Samarkand is where my mom and eventually my sister and I were born. Actually, my grandpa's family came back to Ukraine at first after the temporary evacuation, where he met my grandma. They married and she went with him to Uzbekistan.

Uzbekistan is where I was born and my mom, sister, and me immigrated to the US as Jewish refugees when I was a kid.
