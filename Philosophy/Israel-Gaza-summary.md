I’m proposing solar shingles and TVs and organic steaks. Israel is at best proposing ramen-drops amid drone strikes. 

People aren’t robots, but they are programmed by wants and needs. If you provide for all their wants and needs, you can safely assume they won’t protest against you. 

Palestine is below the global poverty line. That’s like $2 a day. If you get all of them well above the global poverty line, there won’t be a Hamas because there won’t be a citizenry to want to join Hamas.

You might say, “Well they’re religious zealots!” You might say so, but first and foremost they’re below the global poverty line.

Keep doing what you’re doing, e.g. “drone strikes”, but just replace the missiles with abundant food, housing and energy supplies, and good-faith communications. Whoever does that first, be it Israel or Hamas or Japan or Martians or Chris Rock, is whoever God will give the land to.

Otherwise, this cycle will keep repeating because, if there is a God, His all-wise story for the war in the Middle East isn't going to be some cliche hack.

It'll be the first ever proof of love as a war strategy.
