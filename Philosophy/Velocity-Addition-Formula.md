# Disproving experimental evidence

Einstein used his first postulate, the constancy of the speed of light *in vacuo* across reference frames, to derive the Lorentz transformation. This postulate states and necessitates the following:

$x = ct$

$\rightarrow \frac{\partial x}{\partial t} = c$

and

$x' = ct'$

$\rightarrow \frac{\partial x'}{\partial t'} = c$.

However, for pretty much all bodies described by $x$ in experiment and application, *e.g.*, an electron, the body's velocity $\frac{\partial x}{\partial t}$ is measured or presumed below the speed of light *in vacuo* constant: $\frac{\partial x}{\partial t} < c$. These use cases cannot be valid at the same time as $x = ct$ is necessitated by Einstein's first postulate, since $x = ct \rightarrow \frac{\partial x}{\partial t} = c$.

The Fizeau experiment, for example, one of the main corroborations of the special theory of relativity, used the velocity-addition formula on a light beam's position through a tube of flowing water, describing the light beam's position in the respective reference frames of the tube and the contained flowing water medium, with $\frac{\partial x}{\partial t} \neq c$ measured, and $\frac{\partial x'}{\partial t'} \neq c$ assumed.

Such applications of Einstein's theory can't be valid at the same time as Einstein's first postulate. The object in motion must be defined to travel at exactly the speed of light: $\frac{\partial x}{\partial t} = \frac{\partial x'}{\partial t'} = c$ by implication of Einstein's first postulate. Einstein's first postulate is necessary to his derivation of the Lorentz transformation, and the latter is necessary to the derivation of the velocity-addition formula.

## Velocity-addition formula 

In the first postulate, Einstein defined $x$ and $x'$ as spatial coordinates in two reference frames $K$ and $K'$ respectively such that the body whose position is represented by these spatial coordinates is always measured as traveling at speed $c$, independent to reference frame. Namely, he described a beam of light, *in vacuo*,  emitting from the intersecting origins of the reference frames. The referent body of $x$ and $x'$ must have speed $c$ in both reference frames, despite the ubiquitous misuse, according to the first postulate. Below, the misunderstanding is derived via this postulate's implication to the commonly used velocity-addition formula.

### Deriving the velocity-addition formula 

Assume the Lorentz transformation. We have:

$\partial x = \frac{\partial x' + v \partial t'}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}$

$\partial t = \frac{\partial t' + \frac{v \partial x'}{c^2}}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}$

$\frac{\partial x}{\partial t} = \frac{\frac{\partial x' + v \partial t'}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}}{\frac{\partial t' + \frac{v \partial x'}{c^2}}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}} = \frac{\partial x' + v \partial t'}{\partial t' + \frac{v \partial x'}{c^2}} = \frac{\frac{1}{\partial t'}(\partial x' + v \partial t')}{\frac{1}{\partial t'}(\partial t' + \frac{v \partial x'}{c^2})} = \frac{\frac{\partial x'}{\partial t'} + v}{1 + \frac{v}{c^2}\frac{\partial x'}{\partial t'}}$.

### Utility of the velocity-addition formula 

This commonly used formula cannot in principle be usable in combination with Einstein's first postulate since the latter requires $\frac{\partial x}{\partial t}  = \frac{\partial x'}{\partial t'} = c$ always. Substituting as such the above gives us:

$$
\begin{align}
&\frac{\partial x}{\partial t} = \frac{\frac{\partial x'}{\partial t'} + v}{1 + \frac{v}{c^2}\frac{\partial x'}{\partial t'}} \\
&\rightarrow c = \frac{c + v}{1 + \frac{v}{c^2}c} \\
&\rightarrow c = \frac{c + v}{1 + \frac{v}{c}} \\
&\rightarrow c(1 + \frac{v}{c}) = c + v \\
&\rightarrow c + v = c + v \\
&\rightarrow 1 = 1, \\
\end{align}
$$

rendering the formula useless.

# Deriving the velocity-addition formula (most rigorously)

In case the above derivation of the velocity-addition formula doesn't satisfy one's preference of rigor, here is a derivation of the velocity-addition formula from absolute scratch. This derivation is besides the point of the earlier disproof, and is constructed just as a simple but rigorous derivation of the velocity-addition formula, for educating and organizing's-sake.

## Definitions.

### (1) Speed of light constant *in vacuo*, reference frame, and spacetime.

Let $c \coloneqq 299,792,458$ be the speed of light constant *in vacuo*.

Reference frame $K^{(i)}$ (for any $i \in \mathbb{N}$) is a coordinate system that is potentially in motion relative to other reference frames (coordinate systems likewise potentially in motion, for example $K^{(j)}$).

Any observer stationary in reference frame $K^{(i)}$ measures the corresponding time and space coordinates of a body, as $t^{(i)}  \in \mathbb{R}$ and $x_{t^{(i)}}^{(i)} \in \mathbb{R}$ respectively.

$v^{(i, j)} \in \mathbb{R}$ is the velocity of any body stationary in $K^{(j)}$ measured by any observer stationary in $K^{(i)}$.

### (2) Lorentz transformation.

$\mathcal{X}(X, T, V) \coloneqq \frac{X - VT}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{V^2}{c^2}}}$.

$\mathcal{T}(X, T, V) \coloneqq \frac{T - \frac{XV}{c^2}}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{V^2}{c^2}}}$.

### (3) Velocity-addition formula.

$\mathcal{V}(V, W) \coloneqq \frac{W + V}{1 + \frac{V}{c^2}W}$.

## Assumptions

### (1) Lorentz transformation.

$x_{t^{(j)}}^{(j)} \coloneqq \mathcal{X}(x_{t^{(i)}}^{(i)}, t^{(i)}, v^{(i, j)})$.

$t^{(j)} \coloneqq \mathcal{T}(x_{t^{(i)}}^{(i)}, t^{(i)}, v^{(i, j)})$.

The Lorentz transformation describes a transformation of a body's correponding space and time coordinates across reference frames in physical spacetime.

### (2) Mutual velocity perspective.

$v^{(i, j)} \coloneqq -v^{(j, i)}$.

This is assumed generally as well as in Einstein's second postulate ("the principle of relativity").

<!--
**(3) Einstein's first postulate: The speed of light *in vacuo* across all reference frames is constant.**

$x_{t^{(i)}}^{(i)} = c t^{(i)}$

**(4)** $\frac{\partial x}{\partial t} \neq c$.

As assumed in most experimentally tested setups, e.g., Fizeau.
-->

### (3) Uniform motion.

$K^{(i)}$ is an inertial reference frame:

$\frac{\partial x_{t^{(i)}}^{(i)}}{\partial t^{(i)}}$ is constant, or equivalently, $\frac{\partial^2 x_{t^{(i)}}^{(i)}}{\partial {t^{(i)}}^2} = 0$.

This is always assumed in special relativity.

Since average velocity is equal to displacement over time, a necessary consequence of constant $\frac{\partial x_{t^{(i)}}^{(i)}}{\partial t^{(i)}}$ is:

$\frac{\partial x_{t^{(i)}}^{(i)}}{\partial t^{(i)}} = \frac{\Delta x_{t^{(i)}}^{(i)}}{\Delta t^{(i)}} = \frac{x_{t^{(i)}}^{(i)} - x_{0}^{(i)}}{t^{(i)} - 0}$.

### (4) $x_{0}^{(i)} = 0$.

$x_{0}^{(i)} = 0$ means that the origin ($0$-point) of reference frame $K^{(i)}$ is conformed with wherever the body (whose spatial coordinate is represented by $x_{t^{(i)}}^{(i)}$) is at time $t^{(i)} = 0$, denoted by $x_{0}^{(i)}$. If this conformation isn't already the case, then reference frame $K^{(i)}$ can be redefined such that $x_{0}^{(i)} = 0$ by means of a fixed translation in space of the measuring system, simply by subtracting the previous value of $x_{0}^{(i)}$ from all measurements of $x_{t^{(i)}}^{(i)}$. Such a re-centering has no effect on relative velocities $v^{(i,j)}$ or $v^{(j,i)}$ between observers and bodies on and across reference frames. Alternatively, if this isn't satisfying, $x_{0}^{(i)} = 0$ may also be derived directly as a necessary consequence of the constancy of light postulate, which states that $x_{t^{(i)}}^{(i)} = ct^{(i)}$: 

$x_{t^{(i)}}^{(i)} = ct^{(i)} \rightarrow x_{0}^{(i)} = c(0) = 0 \rightarrow x_{0}^{(i)} = 0$.

## Theorems

### (1) Velocity-addition formula.

$\frac{\partial x_{t^{(i)}}^{(i)}}{\partial t^{(i)}} = \mathcal{V}(v^{(i, j)}, \frac{\partial x_{t^{(j)}}^{(j)}}{\partial t^{(j)}})$.

The velocity-addition formula describes a transformation of a body's velocity across reference frames in physical spacetime.

**Proof.**

$$
\begin{align}
  \frac{\partial x_{t^{(i)}}^{(i)}}{\partial t^{(i)}} &= \frac{x_{t^{(i)}}^{(i)} - x_{0}^{(i)}}{t^{(i)} - 0} \quad\quad \text{(Assumption 3)}\\
  &= \frac{x_{t^{(i)}}^{(i)}}{t^{(i)}} \quad\quad \text{(Assumption 4)}\\
  &= \frac{\mathcal{X}(x_{t^{(j)}}^{(j)}, t^{(j)}, v^{(j, i)})}{\mathcal{T}( x_{t^{(j)}}^{(j)}, t^{(j)}, v^{(j, i)})} \quad\quad \text{(Assumption 1)}\\
  &= \frac{\mathcal{X}(x_{t^{(j)}}^{(j)}, t^{(j)}, -v^{(i, j)})}{\mathcal{T}( x_{t^{(j)}}^{(j)}, t^{(j)}, -v^{(i, j)})} \quad\quad \text{(Assumption 2)}\\
\end{align}
$$

$$
\begin{align}
  &= \frac{\Bigg(\frac{x_{t^{(j)}}^{(j)} + v^{(i, j)} t^{(j)}}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{{v^{(i, j)}}^2}{c^2}}}\Bigg)}{\Bigg(\frac{t^{(j)} + \frac{v^{(i, j)} x_{t^{(j)}}^{(j)}}{c^2}}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{{v^{(i, j)}}^2}{c^2}}}\Bigg)} \quad\quad \text{(Definition 2)}\\
  &= \frac{x_{t^{(j)}}^{(j)} + v^{(i, j)} t^{(j)}}{t^{(j)} + \frac{v^{(i, j)} x_{t^{(j)}}^{(j)}}{c^2}} \\
  &= \frac{(\frac{1}{t^{(j)}})(x_{t^{(j)}}^{(j)} + v^{(i, j)} t^{(j)})}{(\frac{1}{t^{(j)}})(t^{(j)} + \frac{v^{(i, j)} x_{t^{(j)}}^{(j)}}{c^2})}\\
\end{align}
$$


$$
\begin{align}
\quad \quad \quad \quad \text{ }&= \frac{\frac{x_{t^{(j)}}^{(j)}}{t^{(j)}} + v^{(i, j)}}{1 + \frac{v^{(i, j)}}{c^2}\frac{x_{t^{(j)}}^{(j)}}{t^{(j)}}} \\
&= \frac{\frac{x_{t^{(j)}}^{(j)} - x_{0}^{(j)}}{t^{(j)} - 0} + v^{(i, j)}}{1 + \frac{v^{(i, j)}}{c^2}\frac{x_{t^{(j)}}^{(j)}- x_{0}^{(j)}}{t^{(j)} - 0}} \quad\quad \text{(Assumption 4)} \\
&= \frac{\frac{\partial x_{t^{(j)}}^{(j)}}{\partial t^{(j)}} + v^{(i, j)}}{1 + \frac{v^{(i, j)}}{c^2}\frac{\partial x_{t^{(j)}}^{(j)}}{\partial t^{(j)}}} \quad\quad \text{(Assumption 3)}\\
&= \mathcal{V}(v^{(i, j)}, \frac{\partial x_{t^{(j)}}^{(j)}}{\partial t^{(j)}}). \quad\quad \text{(Definition 3)} \quad\quad\quad \square
\end{align}
$$

#

Einstein's first postulate, the constancy of the speed of light *in vacuo* across reference frames, states: $x_{t^{(i)}}^{(i)} = ct^{(i)}$.

$$
\begin{align}
x_{t^{(i)}}^{(i)} &= ct^{(i)} \\
\rightarrow \frac{\partial x_{t^{(i)}}^{(i)}}{\partial t^{(i)}} &= c, \\
\end{align}
$$

rendering the formula useless.
