The requirement for reviews is documented in the CS PhD Student Handbook.  Deadlines for reviews are communicated to all PhD students and advisors via email every year.

Hi Michael,

I was excused from the one I missed in Fall, 2022, as detailed below (due to Henry's absence), and remediated it in Spring, 2023. The one in Spring, 2023, I passed, under the condition that I provide the committee with a one-page chapter-list (or at least that was what was said during the meeting). I will remind you that this was a brand new committee and that one of the committee members didn't remember that meeting. Chris Kanan's pretty extraordinary memory lapse, as you'll recall, is documented on email. 30-minute Zoom meeting that the four of us had as being 1.5 hours and not once, but twice! My goodness. It was scheduled for 30 minutes, as the other committee members can hopefully recall: 20 minutes reserved for my presentation and the last 10 minutes for their independent-room discussion and final remarks. After that six-month review, and the independent-room discussion that followed and after they laid out what I had to do next (a one-page chapter-list), I was informed of the following requirements not originally decided by the committee:

(1) before June 5, 2023, provide a 1-page write up that addresses the problem statement, hypothesis, and approaches of the thesis and give an outline of thesis chapters, </br>
(2) before August 30, 2023, re-do and pass a six-month review.

I sent them the chapter-list as well as a 6-page write-up containing the problem statement, hypothesis, and approaches (and made sure to cleanly summarize those parts on approximately a single page in that write-up), as documented on email also. In total, I sent a 6-page write-up instead of a 1-page write-up as well as the originally required chapter-list.

A six-month review, to remind you, is an informal meeting meant to help the student. The grad school, not me, should be accountable for committee members and an advisor, and then a second advisor, leaving (especially with short, no, or again short notice).

My question is, since I felt your answer was disingenuous: whether the second requirement ("before August 30, 2023, re-do and pass a six-month review.") was mentioned at any point at/between the time of termination and October 31st, by anyone other than me (since I conveniently mentioned it for you in my grad department email of October 30th).

Regarding Henry's absence, Chenliang was aware from Fall semester into Spring semester that I had missed that six-month review, most likely understanding that: (1) six-month reviews are informal assessments meant to help the student, not live-or-die assessments on which termination can be suspiciously, ambiguously, and retroactively justified, and (2) Henry couldn't attend, which I was not notified of until last-minute (Chenliang, not Henry, notified me, last-minute just at that six-month review time point, that my former advisor and active committee member was retiring and wouldn't be available). After I was excused (by my advisor, and as far as I could know department), I was not notified again until the Spring one with a new committee, since one other committee member had left. 

Now, to remind you, I also suffered many induced and excruciatingly severe tragedies while I was employed and working as a student that the university did not yet address. 

However, for now, it would mean a lot to me if you could answer my question [yes/no, specify when, and provide a quotation as proof].

This was the question:

> Was this six-month review mentioned at/between the time of my termination and October 31st?

Since you bring up deadlines, I just want to add that I was notified of my stipend being cut prior to the six-month review deadline, as Chenliang, the entire committee, and you yourself can confirm.
