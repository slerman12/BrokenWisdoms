## Sam and Marina from<!--of--> Samarkand and Maracanda

<!--
Many Jews were tortured, executed, and piled in bodies, when the Nazis occupied Ukraine. Ukraine was already sympathetic with Nazi anti-semitism before the occupation, but now Jews in droves fled to Russia, or Muslim nations to the East, a number of days train ride away, like Kazakhstan or Uzbekistan, for refuge. My grandpa's father, Yakob, couldn't evacuate because he was drafted to fight in the war front. My grandpa's mom Maná, my grandpa's younger sister Rosá, and my grandpa, Yury, who was about 13, fled to Kazakhstan together. At the end of the war, they returned to Chernihiv, Ukraine, and reunited with Yakob.

Many Jews were tortured, executed, and piled in bodies, when the Nazis occupied Ukraine. Ukraine was already sympathetic with Nazi anti-semitism before the occupation. My grandpa's mom Maná, my grandpa's younger sister Rosá, and my grandpa, Yury, who was about 13, fled to Kazakhstan together. At the end of the war, they returned to Chernihiv, Ukraine, and reunited with Yakob, my grandpa's and Rosá's father who'd been drafted to fight in the war front.

When my grandpa turned 16, he officially became "Yury." He was originally named "Izya" at birth, a Jewish name, but his documents with that name were lost during the war and he’d had to go by the less Jewish name, "Yury," or nickname "Yura." That is what he went by after the war, and kept his last name, "Lerman," a German Jewish Ashkenazi last name, that translates approximately to "teacher."

My grandpa then went to a college in Kiev. My grandma, Asya, a "Rabinovich" (her last name, from her dad, Leb, means, "son of Rabbi"), who my grandpa had met before in childhood, a year older than him, went to a different college in Kiev. They met again and married. 

Then the Soviet Union assigned my grandpa to a job at a sheepskin manufacturing <!--plant/-->factory in Samarkand, Uzbekistan, where my grandpa had to work as a leather technology engineer. My grandma had emigrated with him and found a job there, too, teaching German. 

So my grandparents emigrated from Kiev, Zhytomyr, or Chernihiv, to Samarkand, in 1952. 

Samarkand, an ancient city in Uzbekistan, with [modest/beautiful architecture](https://travelcocktail.org/samarkand/), is perhaps the oldest historical city in Central Asia and ["one of the most ancient cities in the world,"](https://www.advantour.com/uzbekistan/samarkand/history.htm#:~:text=Samarkand%20is%20one%20of%20the,goes%20back%20in%20remote%20days.) having been a significant junction of trade routes [between China and India](https://www.britannica.com/place/Samarkand-Uzbekistan), [as well as Europe](https://www.euronews.com/travel/2015/10/19/samarkand-s-silk-road-treasures), during ancient and medieval times. During the Soviet era, Russian was the dominant language, Uzbek the official language on documents<!--, while Islam was the most common religion-->. Islam is the dominant religion. This city represents [a rich intersection of history, trade, and culture.](https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/603/)

<!--
. Since the 8th century, since also sharing religion with the Middle East, it [is an intersection of history, trade, and culture](https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/603/) as a city.
-->

My uncle Slava was the first descendant of my grandparents, then my mom Nélya, both born in Samarkand. Then, via my aunt Jenya, my older cousins Lena and Irina.

My cousins, sister, and I were also all born in Samarkand, all of us also Ashkenazi Jews. 

When my mom was 33, she had my older sister Marina. 

When my mom was 38, she had me. 

"Sam and Marina from Samarkand and Maracanda" is entirely chance. My older sister was named after Maná, but my mom wanted a name that felt somewhat different. Samarkand happens to be also named Maracanda, or at least was in the 4th century BCE, but my <!--sister's naming with respect to "Maracanda" wasn't by my mom's purpose or intention. My -->mom just liked the name "Marina." My name, "Sam" from Samarkand, happened in America, <!--accidentally, entirely--> by <!--coincidence, or--> chance. I was named "Siímyon," after my grandma's sister's (Tslia's) late husband Siímyon. He died several years before I was born. "Siímyon" is my full name. "Syoma" is what I go by with my family. Later American [translations](#immigration) caused it to become "Sam."

My name, "Sam of Samarkand," happened entirely by chance, and in America, accidentally, by coincidence. I was named "Siímyon," after my grandma's sister's (Tslia's) late husband Siímyon. He died several years before I was born. That's the full name. "Syoma" is what I go by with my family.

<!--
Put this in Synchronicities:
## Marina of Maracanda

My older sister, Marina, is named after my grandpa's sister Maná, but my mom wanted a somewhat different feeling name. My mom didn't know this (no, she did), and I didn't know this either until I literally just clicked this link that used to reference the ["world's most ancient city"](https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/603/) thing earlier, but Samarkand also happens to be named Maracanda. Nice!

## Eczema at infancy <!--(*difficulty at the beginning*)-->

I had severe eczema from a month and a half "age" old. I got this itchiness, and scratched myself, scratched myself to blood. I itched the whole body, cried, scratched myself, scratched, cried. My mom had to put cloths on my hands, babies' cloths to cover my hands, so I'd not scratch to blood.

When I was 2, about 3, a family friend, Shafkad, said there is some man in some village, some far away village, who can treat people, a healer, a shaman, not a traditional healer, and he said he can take us there to see what this person can say or do; maybe he can heal me from eczema. He drove us there, and we went to some village, not-civilized-looking village. There, a man (a different man, not the healer) came, somebody Shafkad knew, and this man said, "I'll take him to that healer. No you stay here." My mom wanted to go. "No. You not allowed." Maybe because she was a woman and it was Muslim, they didn't let her go there. She was worried. Shafkad assured that everything is alright either way. He knows these people. "No no. They good people. They heal."

They were waiting and after some time, maybe 20 minutes, they brought me back, two people, the guy who took me and another, the shaman, healer, a short man, Uzbek or Tajik maybe, native-Uzbek looking, middle age, maybe 40 something, 50. He said he couldn't heal me, that he got rid of all demons from me and couldn't heal it. "Sorry. I couldn't. I don't know how to. I couldn't help your son. I don't know how to fix it." 

He didn't take money. He just said, "I couldn't heal him. I can't."

The shaman somehow knew that we were immigrating. My mom didn't know how. She thought maybe Shafkad told him. Somehow he knew. He said, "Are you going to America? Maybe they can heal him. They have better doctors there."

<!--The shaman somehow knew that we were immigrating. Maybe Shafkad told him — somehow he knew. My mom didn't know how.-->

## Induced hair loss <!--(*fellowship with man*)-->

In the summer immediately at the head of my first year as a PhD student, my university-hospital doctor Lisa Beck prescribed a medication called Dupilumab. It's a biologic agent that one injects into their stomach that laser-targets a specific antibody associated with eczema. My eczema was severe and debilitating. Some time into taking the medication — I think maybe 8 months — my university-provided health insurance Aetna cut me off from the drug without warning. I wasn't notified by Aetna or my doctor, or the university-owned hospital, but by the university-owned intermediary deliverer, who was responsible for delivering the drug on a recurring basis to my doorstep, since it can't — or at least at the time couldn't — be provided for pick-up at a pharmacy. They called me and told me they couldn't reach my doctor, but for some reason Aetna had decided to no longer cover the prescription. 

`Aetna cut me off from Dupilumab about 8 months into my dependency without warning.`

`The deliverer couldn't reach my doctor.`

I remember walking up and down Mt. Hope Avenue with my phone in a panic calling my doctor trying to reach her, and the university deliverer telling me they were trying to do the same and couldn't reach her either. After a while, my hair started falling out rapidly. I have no genetic predisposition to baldness, from any side of my family. The abnormally rapid hair loss was obviously due to the dependency and cessation. 

Though it fell out quickly, I didn't notice at first. The shower drains were filled with hair every day, and I thought it was maybe my housemate's girlfriend's. I didn't get to see my doctor until later in the summer (when her office had scheduled it: August 14), a long time after, when I think much of the side and top of my head were bald. She diagnosed it as Alopecia Areata as a result of the sudden cessation of Dupilumab. To be clear, she diagnosed it as Alopecia Areata as a result of the sudden cessation<!-- of Dupilumab-->. She and her nurse took pictures and stored them in the university-hospital computers. 

`I wasn't given the appointment with my doctor until months after.`
<!--`I wasn't given an appointment with my doctor until at least a month, maybe two months or more, after the missed injection.`-->

`The cessation initially caused Alopecia Areata.`

Eventually, she sorted out things with the university-provided health insurance, but by then it was too late. Most of my hair had fallen out.

`The drug was delivered after I lost my hair.`

<!--## Premonitions-->

We finally got a delivery of the drug. I wasn't sure whether it'd be safer at that point to re-instigate the dependency/addiction or avoid the drug at all costs.

Here's a personal story, since I was fixated with Taoism at the time:

To help me weigh the difficult decision — and it was difficult because that medication was extremely potent and didn't even help my eczema much, and I believed my hair would grow back — I asked the I Ching. Here I'll describe the hexagrams I got because I find it interesting that one of the predictions came true, and this might be medically useful since it corresponded thrice with my hair growing back (all three resurgences after the Alopecia Areata had developed into Alopecia Universalis, meaning after every piece of hair from my body had fallen out).

`The Alopecia Areata had developed into Alopecia Universalis.`

The I Ching "answered" it didn't matter which of the two paths I chose ("The town may be changed, / But the well cannot be changed. / It neither decreases nor increases." - "The Well", unchanging). (Maybe an interesting observation: that the English "well" is phonetically similar to "wellness," as well). It also had previously "answered" my hair would grow back of its own accord, which it did, temporarily. I still remember: "Difficulty at the beginning" (as Richard Wilhelm described: "The name of the hexagram, Chun, really connotes a blade of grass pushing against an obstacle as it sprouts out of the earth — hence the meaning, 'Difficulty at the beginning'.") $\rightarrow$ (changes to) "Fellowship with man" (e.g., baldness). That answer about whether my hair will grow back came true with the steak-only diet (steak is "manly" and so that again ties to the hexagram symbolism of "Fellowship with man"), almost like a suggestion for how my hair can "sprout" out of the earth, my head, like blades of grass, again... which it did, temporarily but covering my entire head except for an unnoticeable tiny spot at the top of my scalp.

Then all the hair fell out again. Again, total baldness. No eyelashes, eyebrows, or hair.

Another time I did the steak-only diet, my pubic hair fully grew back — temporarily.

Another time I did the steak-only diet, a few eyelashes grew back for the first time. 

That can't be a coincidence, so I leave this story here both for medical utility and for the understanding that [I now look like Gollum](https://www.facebook.com/photo/?fbid=10211230008185126&set=a.1273659620707) because of medical malpractice.

`I now look like Gollum`, and `other Gollum-esque symptoms` (see ["Fall, 2018 semester, and the Dead Marshes"](#fall-2018-semester-and-the-dead-marshes) and ["Nails"](#nails)).
<!--`I now look like Gollum`, and, though I didn't specify them yet here, there were `other "Gollum-esque" symptoms` as well (see ["Fall, 2018 semester, and the Dead Marshes"](#fall-2018-semester-and-the-dead-marshes) and ["Nails"](#nails)).-->

> [!WARNING]
> By the way, the scariest nightmare I ever had, over and over that whole night, was the day I injected Dupilumab the first time. I remember my housemate at the time in the other room and I wanted to wake him. That's how scared I was. The nightmare was of a tall skinny slenderman, who kept approaching to "assault" me. Every time I closed my eyes and fell asleep, he'd reappear. Again and again, for that whole night. I never had a nightmare like that before. It was vivid.

## Suing of Samarkand (*litigating the Republican elephant in the room*, which I don't think is an I Ching hexagram)

I don't think describing why suing doesn't appeal to me is possible to an American audience. Maybe it is. As this book shows, there are better uses of my spirit besides teaching what I know to lawyers.

Whether or not I'm ruling it out must, out of narrative necessity, be left a mystery until the ["Faith"](4-faith.md) chapter.

As that chapter will show, there's an even more appealing direction that all of this has made me crave! And hey, "suing" is still phonetically part of it (is "suiciding" a word though?).

My physical appearance only matters to me for physical attraction. I'd rather make a living by a means that I myself would find attractive in another person.
-->
<!--My physical appearance only matters to me for physical attraction. I'd rather make a living by a means that I myself would find attractive in another person. Not that suing would subtract attraction, but in my case would my morale and time.-->
<!--
BUT, I'm no stranger to some material luck, as it turned out...

My hair fell out while I rented a room in a *house on May St.*, a different place from the floor in the house my cousin Lena's boyfriend was renting out to the roommate I mentioned (my best friend by the way) and me, where I first injected Dupilumab, but it was while living in the [House on May St.](#house-on-may-st), which I leased a room in later, when Aetna had cut me off from the eczema drug.

(Not that suing would subtract attraction, but in my case would my morale, by a lot, more so than committing suicide, and would subtract time). If I’m doing my PhD, or writing this book, or racing with other AI researchers, or have physics work that’s important for everybody, or have medical work that’s important for everybody, or have governance stuff that’s important for everybody, when would I have time to sue? As I'm doing. All of that. [AI](#henry-kautz-limitations-of-western-philosophy), physics (for now linking [this](Philosophy/Velocity-Addition-Formula.md)), [governance](https://github.com/slerman12/Governance/blob/main/Does-Nature-Endorse%3F.md).

# Part 2

## Electric razor 

My grandpa gave me his electric razor when I was in high school. It was the first razor I ever had and the only one I'd ever used through high school and college.

In that 2017 summer, before I started the Dupilumab, my mom and I celebrated my graduation from college ("uni," in European-speak) by going to Europe, and my razor broke in the luggage.

Later that summer, after having started the Dupilumab, I started growing out my beard and mustache for the first time, in my life, entirely independently... while living in the House on May St...

<!--
### Uncanny beard premonition

My grandpa actually gave me his razor, an electric razor. It was the first razor I ever had, that I used to shave in high school and all through college. I was right-handed; I'm sure my grandpa used his left hand; I'm sure Charles was startled when I started coming into the office at the Center for Health and Technology, in the late summer of 2017, with the early traces of a beard.

It was the [first time I grew out my beard](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2d1d366e-14bd-49cd-9a58-dca108e9a144) and I did so out of an intuition, just before Aetna had cut me off from Dupilumab.
-->

## House on May St.

My hair fell out while I lived in my *house on May St.*, a miraculous situation where the landlord — who I'd never met previously — rented me a 4-bedroom nice antique house near both the university and the park in Rochester where the Lilac Festival is held, to myself, for $600/month, starting Fall, 2017 — well, technically one bedroom from that house, but I had the whole place to myself pretty much for the next year, and even furnished at least one other bed from another room since, inexplicably and literally miraculously, the landlord didn't believe he could find anyone on his own without my help to rent out to, and he wanted grad students. 

It was beautiful, and even had a porch and balcony, big kitchen, a freezer for big-game hunting (this detail becomes funny later), basement, dishwasher, and laundry machine. Of some of the PhD students who visited me, some needed housing, and later the landlord and I showed them around the rooms (maybe not even prior to me furnishing any of the other bedrooms, which the landlord didn't mind that I'd done, seeing as my best friend and I also beautifully furnished that whole house together during one of my best friend's visits early when I moved in, really beautifully, and that increased the value of the house more, in addition to the sofa and tables and furnishings and beds and desks that the landlord provided — did I mention the word "miraculous" yet?), and one of them even mentioned to the landlord at the end having the funds to pay the full year's rent already — I don't remember why they ended up not moving in, but that was also clearly miraculous. I did end up renting out the attic (which was like a studio apartment, well, a giant room) to one of my friends from high school for the landlord after maybe 4 months of having the place to myself, and even then it was pretty much entirely my house, though he also set up a DJ station for himself in the basement since he threw raves (not in the house), and had his girlfriend over, but he kept quiet, and he wasn't a grad student, but the landlord had a strong belief in my judgement again, again miraculously.

Pets weren't allowed, but that's okay, because there was a [semi-adopted stray who regularly came to visit me outside and sat with me on (or near) my porch named "Batman" (according to his collar)](https://www.facebook.com/share/v/KXoyjpZeM6tsKRrE/), and I loved him very much if the video doesn't make that clear.

Months before I moved out, I became the admin/moderator of the [university Facebook housing page](https://www.facebook.com/groups/1112684565415024/) by chance, because the actual admin posted he was looking for a student to moderate the page for him, and I responded that I could do it. My landlord didn't know (and probably still doesn't) that I'm the effective-admin/moderator of that page. Also, since then, I've messaged the manager/admin of that group multiple times to give the moderation to someone else or moderate it himself and he hasn't replied, and doesn't appear to use Facebook, so hereforth I'm permitting myself to call myself the admin. I'm glad to moderate, but not super good at keeping up to date with it. So, after there was no chance left of getting to keep the place to just myself and friend longer, I ended up finding University of Rochester grad students to fill all 4 bedrooms of the house, and all 4 bedrooms of the neighboring house, also belonging to the landlord — I think "semi-detached home" is what it's called — and, thanks to the ad I ended up posting ([here it is](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dbe5ceff-3b06-4582-97fb-c13c30d00564)), I redirected inquiries to my landlord's email and my landlord's email flooded with other PhD students looking to fill that house, including one of the ones who'd originally wanted and planned to who I'd notified (he moved into the attached one, closer to what was at the time an abandoned building). I ended up adding my landlord to that page, where, technically I'm not supposed to allow landlords, only students. Sorry for this phrasing, but the landlord's house is now "never lacking" in interested grad students looking to rent from him. In fact, lucky for him, the neighboring commercial building is now [a herbal apothecary](https://www.democratandchronicle.com/story/news/2019/09/19/little-apothecary-becomes-little-herbary-south-ave-rochester-ny/2365775001/), since it was abandoned when I lived there (due to, if I recall correctly, a murder, though I didn't know that moving in).

I also grew out a full beard <!--(except a really small patch probably from a lifetime of topical eczema creams, as my pediatrician told me was happening in high school or college)--> and full mustache mostly in those first months I lived in that May St. house, based on an independent Paleo-based intuition/principle. [Here's a picture with my family at that house from my 22nd birthday](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2d1d366e-14bd-49cd-9a58-dca108e9a144), not too long after I started to grow it out. My best friend [visited me](https://www.facebook.com/share/p/c7m83bHR5v1mP4p4/) on December 15th, 2017 at that house and encouraged me to shave it (just before we went to a rave that day, the other friend's who would later move in with me, coincidentally), some months before Aetna cut me off from the prescription to Dupilumab, but it was the first time I ever grew out my facial hair.

I was working really hard in that house, developing my long-term memory research ideas and implementing the code for it there, meditating every day while practicing strict dietary (Paleo and organic) disciplines, practicing many asceticisms including not watching movies and TV shows, no unnatural lights after 8 PM except candlelight and always going to bed by 10 or 11, reading philosophy books and academic works for entertainment, cooking all of my food fresh, cold rather than hot showers (e.g., Wim Hof method), while working on campus taking full semesters of grad-level classes, and at the University of Rochester's Medical Center, building neural models to predict the progression of Parkinson's disease, and that house is where I started to get my idea for how stochasticity in the universe's quantum mechanics could explain a mechanism for "God" or some intelligent power in nature, hypothetically.

I was sleeping in one of the second bedrooms, when, on a rare occasion, my housemate friend and his girlfriend woke me climbing up the stairs. Somehow I had a sudden realization, near around 3 AM or whatever time it was in that night, that the universe's particles might be random, and therefore can be shifted by slight divergences by an intelligence — like the biological kind (or modeled by the artificial kind) — in such a way that still respects the known laws of physics and yet permits the possibility of an intelligent nature, that can modulate how those particles are sampled with respect to the sampling distributions.

In that house, somewhat before, and thereafter (continuing for years, mostly without pause), I was practicing many disciplines, including meditation, Paleo diet, and ascetic disciplines. I learned the Transcendental Meditation (TM) technique from an instructor, while living there. The instructor I learned from through the TM program was trained directly by the creator/translator of the technique, Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, the guru/yogi the Beatles infamously learned their meditation practice from. I experienced the subtle sinking/melting of my state of consciousness, including visceral physiological sensations, perhaps what some people have observed/called as "Kundalini," that I hadn't heard of yet and came to from Googling my physical sensations, that were a movement in my chest, back of neck/maybe esophagus/throat region, or into my third eye/lobe region, visceral and physical, and that I had full control of the motion of. The meditation brought my consciousness to a sublime state and alleviated my social anxiety.

<!--
Later, after some time without that "Kundalini" sensation, I described how I theorized TM might work to another skeptical PhD student, my friend Mohsen, who'd actually visited me in that house and met "Batman" once, but on a hiking/camping/kayaking/hotel trip much later in the Adirondacks and Niagra Falls, that it had something to do with the distribution of processing systems in the brain. For example: attenuating to a mantra, reduces other area attention activity such that unconscious thinking processes can be allocated. However, while still in the house on May St., I had a different philosophy, involving my physical body, as well as associative and long-term memory —  but I can't remember what it was. I have notes in a small red journal (not a reference to Jung's "Red Book," but I was reading Jung at the time) [here](). To do: find journal and link photos
-->

<!--
The beard had a really small bald patch similar to places on my body where my skin was very smooth that my pediatrician (who I was still seeing in my Freshman year of college) diagnosed while I was a Freshman in college as probably due to the use of prescribed topical creams for eczema on those parts of my body. My chin is one of those areas where I got eczema and had applied those creams through high school and college. My head, eyelashes, armpits, and pubic area weren't.
-->

It was in that house when Aetna cut me off from Dupilumab and my hair started falling out.
<!--
After living in the House on May St., and after my hair had begun falling out, I moved in with my mom to our apartment, where I came up with my [MHDPA innovation paper](https://www.overleaf.com/read/qgmmzgsrctmg#6cd1b9) (the method underlying ChatGPT) in 2018, and it was in the middle of wrapping up that, after all my hair had fallen out, that I was hospitalized (no prior history). It was actually in the first hospitalization, at RGH, where I ran the successful experiments for that paper, since the hospital staff had allowed my mom to bring in my laptop. It was in the second hospital, at the University of Rochester's Strong Hospital (see ["The unsampled world at Clover St."](#the-unsampled-world-at-clover-st)), where I described relational reasoning to my brother-in-law and showed that paper to my fellow inpatient, Sarah (real name used with permission).

After that house, I moved in with my mom to our apartment, where I came up with my [MHDPA innovation paper](https://www.overleaf.com/read/qgmmzgsrctmg#6cd1b9) (the method underlying ChatGPT) in 2018, and it was in the middle of wrapping up that that I was hospitalized (no prior history). It was actually in the first hospitalization, at RGH (see ["Crisis"](#crisis)), where I ran the successful experiments for that paper, since the hospital staff had allowed my mom to bring in my laptop. It was in the second hospital, at the University of Rochester’s Strong Hospital (see ["The unsampled world at Clover St."](#the-unsampled-world-at-clover-st)), where I described relational reasoning to my brother-in-law and showed that paper to my fellow inpatient, Sarah (real name used with permission).

## Psychiatry at the University of Rochester's Strong Hospital

I'm $5\text{'}5\text{'' } 110\text{lb}$.

I had a prescription for benzos before, Xanax, but for eczema and social anxiety, $\text{1/4}$ to $\text{1/2}$ of a milligram to be taken daily or as needed. I took them sometimes during my junior and senior years of college at the University of Rochester, as needed, usually for social anxiety, usually spaced out by more than two weeks, during the time when I took them at all, and they gave me small hangovers/dazes when the effect wore off. Knowing they were in a similar class of drugs to alcohol (see [below](#benzodiazepine-benzos-mechanism-of-action)), I took them conservatively.

I had to stay in the University of Rochester's Strong Hospital for a month and take $48\text{x}$ that dosage, of the comparatively strong-per-duration-per-milligram Ativan, reduced later to $10\text{x}$ that dosage, over the course of $3$ times per day, every day, for that month and more than $5$ months after due to doctor-induced dependence and doctor-dependent tapering scheduling, the details of what was being treated still un-inquired about, incommunicable, and unbeknownst to them, solely derived from the medical record from RGH (see ["My trauma"](#my-trauma) for elaboration on this). Think about that. $\text{1/4}$ to $\text{1/2}$ of a milligram, once every two weeks at most (and usually much more rarely), had side effects. $48\text{x}$ $-$ $10\text{x}$ that dosage, but every day.

Accounting for dosage *and* rate, that's a minimum $336\text{x}$ $-$ $70\text{x}$ &nbsp; to &nbsp; $672\text{x}$ $-$ $140\text{x}$ increase.

Just prior to this, the I Ching had answered to me about the reason for the less-than-ideal consciousness that rules humanity: "Difficulty at the beginning" $\rightarrow$ "Increase." My interpretation: Struggle among people from infancy or childhood, or at the outset of a crisis ("Difficulty at the beginning") $\rightarrow$ (changes to) Perpetual acceleration of interventions, or, more specifically, dependence of an individual, collective, or collective standards and systems on more mechanisms of intervention, rather than pause, substitution, remembrance, reconsideration, or decrease of all of what preceded ("Increase"). Yes, all the I Ching answers specified in this book were/are real. The crisis at the "beginning" can also be interpreted as, for example, one's hair no longer sprouting from one's head, or further yet back to simply eczema. <!--Maybe comment out this last sentence-->

For the first three or so weeks, I was really, really drunk/high. Then the fog rolled in. The chemical waterboarding was taking effect.

[This link opens to a video with a different medical philosophy. It's worth clicking on, no matter one's skepticism.](https://youtu.be/CFtsHf1lVI4?si=c7HOzpchsB2NeP1-)

I was also on antipsychotics, but these next chapters will not be about antipsychotics (see ["Geriatric unit hospitalization"](#geriatric-unit-hospitalization) for some elaboration on antipsychotics), since the benzos were added on top of them, making their evaluative efficacy compared to the damage from benzos hard to disentangle. The rest of this Part will be about the experience that was most-plausibly caused by the benzos.

#

Let's begin a simplified explanation of the brain's neuron. Neurons are cells that are connected to one another by dendrites and axons that pass chemical messengers from one neuron to downstream neurons. The two most common chemical messengers in the brain are the excitatory neurotransmitter Glutamate and the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA. Excitatory means they cause the next neuron to also release their neurotransmitters ("fire"). Inhibitory means they lower the voltage activity of the next neuron such that the next neuron is subdued. GABA is the mechanism of action of alcohol. People think alcohol is "disinhibitory," that it "disinhibits" them, but the reality is alcohol is actually inhibitory. It confuses GABA receptors, causing an inhibition of that neuron and all the neurons in your brain. It's a system-wide drug that indiscriminately simulates GABA throughout every part of your brain, from the Occipital lobe, where your eyes see (in the back of your head), to the frontal lobe, where your brain thinks it thinks.

The brain has evolved some countermeasure thanks <!--at least--> to fermented fruit existing in nature.
<!--
Benzos are GABA agonists, like alcohol. That means they simulate GABA or enhance GABA receptor function. In response, the brain downregulates GABA production and receptor sensitivity universally across the brain, universally, from the parts that are understood to the parts that almost entirely aren't, including some of the most important regions of intelligence whose healthy metric level of functioning is extremely hard to measure behaviorally, clinically, and longitudinally across variants of factors, and necessary for quality living, e.g., the hippocampus responsible for long-term memory. Alcohol does this too, but humans have provably evolved natural mechanisms of recovering from small doses of alcohol thanks to fermented fruit existing in nature. Benzos seem like a Godsend, a Panacea, especially since you're less likely to feel a headache the next day from them for the same effect, but the [evidence isn't strong enough to support they're better on the brain in the long-term than alcohol](https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/health-news/drugs-linked-to-brain-damage-30-years-ago-2127504.html). From what I've gathered, benzos are worse. Since it's somewhat relevant, [here](https://youtu.be/TEKgesBVTJ0?si=OtXQYMZgVd3Qu36M) is a video I made on evolutionary algorithms in deep learning.

Nobody understands this mechanism. To understand this mechanism, you'd have to solve all of neurology and artificial intelligence, and psychiatrists definitely haven't. Benzos are a floodbath of GABA, and your brain responds to those GABA bursts by "downregulation," even long, long after cessation.

Despite the similarities to alcohol, benzos are synthetic, achieve much the same effect without a person being able to notice the same short-term consequences like immediate hangover, and are often prescribed to be taken daily for long periods of time. [Studies haven't shown](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8629021/) that the long-term consequences are preferable to those of alcohol, many [quite the opposite](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10309976/), and <!--(at least)--> my experience<!--, as well as that of [many others](https://www.reddit.com/r/benzorecovery/), taking only as prescribed, were--> was so severe that I <!--would--> strongly bet worse. 
<!--Maybe add if the kind of alcohol matters, e.g., 100% agave blue resposado tequila-->

## My trauma

My trauma revolves around three psychiatrists.

**PSYCHIATRIST 1:** "I will taper you off from the benzos. You will be tapered off *before* discharge."

> `Psychiatrist 1 reassured, I'll be weaned off from the benzos,` *before* `discharge from the hospital.`

**PSYCHIATRIST 2:** "The tapering schedule is too fast (even though we decide when to discharge you) and the outpatient doctor, the psychiatrist after the hospitalization, will taper you off. You will be tapered off *right after* discharge."

> `Psychiatrist 2 came in on the momentum of her previous post (to replace Psychiatrist 1), and changed the schedule, standing next to the first psychiatrist, who hesitantly, self-doubtingly told her that he'd planned to taper me off before the discharge since I was worried.`
>
> `Maybe she didn't trust that I would continue with therapy if the physiological addiction didn't send me there by threat.`
>
> `But she reassured, I'll be weaned off from the benzos,` *right after* `discharge from the hospital.`

**PSYCHIATRIST 3:** "Benzos can be safely taken for years. You need to take them. I want to increase the dose. Did you pull your hair out yourself?"

> `I told Psychiatrist 3 my symptoms. He was cold, authoritative, and disbelieving. He only believed the benzos were needed. He said that benzos could be safely taken for years, and didn't counterargue my points against that that I made to him. At no point for the next 5 months would he specify a tapering schedule, and I was arguing and begging him to taper.`
> 
> `He asked about my hair loss, whether I had pulled the hair out myself. He wouldn't believe me the first couple times I answered. Not only didn't I pull it out myself, but the medical system did, the one that was now making me answer repeatedly whether I did.`
> 
> `I kept begging him to taper in later sessions as well, and he said if I was having all those negative symptoms, that we should increase the dose. That would've started a perpetual race against the brain's downregulation mechanisms.` *He wanted to increase the dose.*

I argued against the benzos with all 3 psychiatrists.

With Psychiatrists 1 and 2, I only took them due to the threat of court order.

With Psychiatrist 3, I only took them due to (a) his recommendation and instruction, (b) the guilt about the earlier hospitalization, and me questioning even the most basic logic and instincts I perceived, while noticeably, adding extremely to the self-doubt, my brain was running slower than others due to the drug, thinking I really was sick in the way these doctors understood, (c) the mental impairment induced by the drug, and (d) insecurity about tapering off by myself, amid the severe physiological dependence.

Furthermore, they were treating a misdiagnosis, "catatonia" — that's what the benzos were prescribed for — that I never went through. I couldn't explain that to them because (a) I didn't know the definition of "catatonia" yet, and (b) the trauma of what I went through was too recent to summarize. 

> `In RGH, they were prescribed due to that false diagnosis of "catatonia." The University of Rochester's Strong Hospital wanted to prevent a recurrence — that is, "preventatively" — threatened a court order if I didn't take them, and 3 psychiatrists changed, contradicted, and perpetually extended each other's scheduling for the taper.`

Additionally, maybe the most unbelievable part: they didn't ask about what I went through. They treated "catatonia" and "bipolar mania" as the indubitably exhaustive description. "Catatonia," which is what the benzos were meant to treat, was fully a misdiagnosis. The other diagnosis from the medical record was "bipolar mania," for which I was being given Risperdals, a strong antipsychotic, in addition to benzos. None of the previous diagnoses from the first hospitalization, none of what RGH wrote, were investigated or asked about in any extent by the University of Rochester's psychiatrists.

Due to their practices, I was on benzos for >6 months. 

Symptoms from taking the benzos as prescribed included: 
- [Severe cognitive impairment](https://www.reddit.com/r/benzorecovery/comments/cdmid6/is_extreme_brain_fog_normal_before_even_beginning/)
- [Constant rightward spinning sensation](https://www.reddit.com/r/kundalini/comments/h8n3ve/lopsided_and_slanted_kundalini_sensations/)
- [Tinnitus](https://www.reddit.com/r/kundalini/comments/j1finq/tinnitus_in_just_left_ear/)
- Mouth dryness, and tooth calcification, as diagnosed as being due to benzos by dental hygienist
  - Chunks of what I thought were tooth were falling out after the benzos that she diagnosed as decalcification
- Severe generalized anxiety, previously undiagnosed
- [Severe social anxiety](https://www.reddit.com/r/socialanxiety/comments/dzx7or/not_to_get_into_toxic_territory_but_sometimes_i/)
- Inability to sleep due to anxiety
-  [Memory loss, and "greyness" of imaginative and creative ability](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/316ec47a-248e-4141-9eb7-5888bc1ea93d)
- [Severe loss of speech and writing quality](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/316ec47a-248e-4141-9eb7-5888bc1ea93d)
- [Severe pain](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/dyaf8n/constant_chest_pain_that_spikes_into_my_neck/)
- [Facial structure changed, wrinkled, and my face rapidly lost a healthy appearance](https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/1dyn2es/comment/lce3ie3/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) 
- Severe physiological dependence, which benzos cause more so, at least neurologically, than Dupilumab, which also causes/caused a physiological dependence
- PTSD from all of these symptoms and the recurrence of a malpractice-induced perhaps-permanent trauma
- [Scientifically-backed](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10309976/) fear of permanent damage
- [More than a year of all of this, no sleep, non-stop persisting neurochemical torture](https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/cksl7u/health_disaster_brain_damage_alopecia_universalis/)

Almost nearing Fall, 2019, I tried to kill myself. The helium tank connected to tubing was found by my mom, and my family hid it from me.

A deeper summary of my benzo trauma can be found [here](#flying-colors). <!--[here](https://github.com/slerman12/BrokenWisdoms/blob/4399be6729f1369e27a3df35eef58fbfe94dcf23/2-Opposing-views.md#my-trauma).-->

The experience of losing my hair has cost me relationships and worsened my social anxiety, and the benzo-brain damage and torture leaves me with PTSD.

## PhD program

### Embassy interview

My grandma's sister, "Tsotya" ("aunt") Tsilia, and her son, my uncle Sasha, a mathematics professor at the Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT), were the first to immigrate to America. My grandma, uncle Slava, and mom applied for refugee status to immigrate as well. <!--My grandma, uncle, and mom applied for refugee status to immigrate as well.--> My grandparents and uncle's family were approved, whereas my mom, sister, and I, weren't. So my grandparents and uncle immigrated, and my grandparents sent an invitation to my mom through the embassy. My mom had to fly with us to Moscow, in January, to do an interview at the American Embassy in Moscow to convince them that she was subjugated. <!--My mom had to fly with us to Moscow, in the *freezing cold* of January — she couldn't move her hands in her gloves, they were so numb — to interview at the American Embassy in Moscow to convince them that she was subjugated so she could join her family.-->

"Your form said you have kids. Where are they?"

She had spent the whole day at the embassy, from early morning to night. She said, "I left them with relatives. I cannot bring them here. They would be suffering here. My youngest is 3. It would be torture for them here, without food, without sleep."

Jenya's brother's family lived in Moscow, so my mom was able to leave us with them while she went to the embassy to petition for refugee status.

"A lot of people bring their children here. They think that showing children to us will gain them sympathy, and pity."

"I thought I didn't have to bring them. The documentation said we didn't."

"Yes yes, you're right," the interviewer said. "Why, to America, you're going?"

"I'm going to meet with my family, mom, dad, my brother is already there. I'm the only one left, with my children. My cousin, my brother, everyone is already there. And, second, because there is anti-semitism in Uzbekistan."

"What, in Uzbekistan, you suffered persecution?"

Anti-semitism in Uzbekistan wasn't as bad as in other countries, she told me. In Ukraine, anti-semitism was always worse, from the war when my grandpa was young, to when my mom was an adult. <!--However, she told me, Jews customarily weren't allowed to hold higher offices in Uzbekistan.-->

"I was at the conservatory. I wanted to study in a PhD program. I couldn't. First, when I was a student, I wanted to continue my studies as a PhD student, but there wasn't a chance for me, because I was Jewish."

She wasn't allowed to do a doctoral, despite having graduated with a diploma with distinction for both college and in the conservatory of music where she earned her master's degree in Music Theory. Her thesis was recommended as the best research paper for publishing, recommended by a woman professor at Moscow Conservatory of Music who came from Russia to listen to the presentations, and my mom submitted it, but it was never published, because "Lerman" is a Jewish name, not Uzbek name.

She continued, "Jewish people don't openly keep their traditions there, they don't get good jobs/positions. I was professor teaching at music college. I had to stop working there last year [in 1998], because they reduced my hours, and not just me, but other Jewish people. Uzbeks they gave many." As a result, my uncle had found her a temporary job for an American firm instead, that had originally been offered to him, where she did indexing, tabulating, and auditing, nothing to do with music theory, despite having been a professor at the music college, respected and always well loved by her students. 

To get refugee status, she had to argue to the interviewer that she deserved refugee status from Uzbekistan, a Muslim country, a Jewish woman <!--with a master's degree--> whose parents and brother already immigrated from Uzbekistan and were already approved by the same consulate for refugee status.
<!--
The interview ended.
-->

### Immigration

Our yard gate in Samarkand was 33 Uzbekistan St., which today we are told by a friend who visited that it's 27 Uzbekistan St., and by the looks of her photos, the neighborhood is completely, absolutely different from when we lived there.

We flew to NYC for one night, immigrating officially as Jewish refugees, half a year since the embassy interview, then to Rochester, New York after that night. I was 3 and two thirds, and had cried, perhaps foretellingly, on the plane from Uzbekistan. My name, was legally mistranslated to "Semen," later nicknamed by my kindergarten teacher "Sem." My mom (whose name was translated "Nellya") found a low-paying piano teaching job, and hoped to earn more money, so she got another degree, an associate's degree, at Monroe Community College, in Computer Information Systems, again [graduating with distinction](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f6183641-3c06-4c82-ba4d-662d0be0dbba). She ended up working multiple jobs, one as a piano teacher giving individual lessons for a piano studio, and another as a part-time computer tutor in two different labs at the community college where she received her associate's degree. My mom's students loved her in America, too. My mom taught me how to program when I took my first-ever computer science class, at the University of Rochester, since the professor wasn't good. In fact, he was really bad. She taught me, through quick intuition, object-oriented programming, and helped me with projects and labs in Java. 

<!--(name removed) who lives in Israel, went to Uzbekistan (Samarkand) and sent a photo, photos of Samarkand, and mentioned the numbers changed because she said she walked by her home, near our yard, where in the photos my mom says it was unrecognizable says it wasn’t ours, but Sima said it was ours. Completely looked different, nothing like our yard, our gate.-->
<!--We immigrated from Uzbekistan St. 27, which at the time was Uzbekistan St. 33-->
<!--But she remembers for sure the house address was 33 Uzbekistan St.-->
<!--My mom found the photos (name removed) sent. From 2018. 27 number.-->
<!--Doesn’t look like it. Completely doesn’t look like it. Absolutely doesn’t look like it. My mom thinks Sin was mistaken. Maybe even a different street.-->
<!--There are photos we have inside the yard behind the gate, and my mom drew a little schematic on a sticky note.-->

7 semesters later, I [graduated](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2ea5fb2f-7c92-48e0-87aa-4df7d7eb168c) with two bachelors degrees, in [Computer Science](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1fe07066-f9ee-4e49-9016-60481d0d5e07) [and Mathematics](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1fe07066-f9ee-4e49-9016-60481d0d5e07). Thanks to work ethic and intelligence, that I inherited from my mom, and some luck, I got into a doctoral program.

Well, thanks also to my doctoral advisor, Henry.

Well, thanks also-also to my best friend, same one I mentioned before. He helped me edit together my statement of purpose and encouraged me as I took and re-took the GRE.

Unlike my mom not being able to in Uzbekistan, I got into the PhD program. I was gonna be a Doctor! I was gonna be the first Doctor of all of my *ancestors*, as far as I knew!

Before accepting me into his doctoral candidacy, Henry connected me to Charles Venuto at the Center for Health and Technology a year into their efforts to model Parkinson's disease (PD) progression. Charles hired me as an undergrad researcher to work with another student, a friend of mine from an on-campus living community, in the UR Medicine Saunders Research Building, where I took on the responsibility of modeling Parkinson's disease for the next several years, including having co-led with that friend the PPMI Data Challenge project, a high-profile data contest hosted by the Michael J. Fox Foundation, which asked, "What factors at baseline predict clinical progression?"

## Charles Venuto

Charles was my Med Center advisor.

<!--Henry recommended me to the position while I was still an undergrad, before the hair loss and benzo brain damage.--> 
Forebodingly, my research under Charles was neurodegenerative modeling. "Neurodegeneration" is when the brain degenerates, for example, due to severe GABA downregulation, as by prolonged chemical floodbaths of GABA from benzodiazepines (as study results have shown: ["current use at baseline was significantly associated with lower total brain volume as well as volumes of the hippocampus, amygdala, and thalamus"](https://bmcmedicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12916-024-03437-5)).

While I was working and researching under Charles, I had come up with, programmed, run the experiments for, and done most of the writing for the paper/contest-submission for a [disease prognostication machine learning model](https://github.com/slerman12/DiseaseModeling) that won top-three in the Michael J. Fox Foundation for Parkinson's Research PPMI  contest, and came up with the idea of building a web app for the prognostication to give clinicians a clean, elegant interface. I had to argue a bit, and convince them, and then they let me, and, as a PhD student (in the early Fall of my third year, already in post-benzo withdrawal), [I even presented it at a conference in DC](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b77731f5-c99a-42f3-a3c2-811cadeb38a2) in front of renowned researchers in the Parkinson's research field. Despite that being my idea and my [prototype](https://github.com/slerman12/DiseaseModelingWebApp), that I had to argue for, build, and present to make credible, all by myself (and in part while in severe withdrawal), they liked it so much that they hired a web development team to build one, didn't put me on that team, and since have never given me credit. Charles also said they were going to patent it having even contacted a patent lawyer, and since have given me no information or updates about that either, or attributions or royalties.

I hope Charles and his colleagues may find the above diagram (["5 Computational Neurons"](#benzodiazepine-benzos-mechanism-of-action)) valuable in their work, ideally attributing credit. It elucidates original mechanisms of neurodegeneration biologically, computationally, and in psychiatric practice. 

<!--But before we come to the conclusion that Charles is caught "red-handed," he was very supportive as my advisor; and he was left-handed, I recall, like my grandpa.-->
<!--Charles was very supportive as my advisor. And he was left-handed, I recall. My grandpa was also left-handed. On the website, though, Charles *and his bosses/team*, were, red-handed.-->
Charles was very supportive as my advisor. He was left-handed. My grandpa was also left-handed. On the website, though, Charles was red-handed.

## Henry Kautz <!--(Limitations of Western philosophy)-->
  
The top-three contest-winning Parkinson's disease progression models I built at the Med Center in college as an undergrad earned me a recommendation back to Henry Kautz, [as well as an embarrassing interview](https://www.rochester.edu/newscenter/undergraduate-students-place-in-top-three-in-parkinsons-disease-data-science-contest-228912/). On top of that, I built [a sleek website interface for Twitter GNIP's involved data mining API](https://github.com/slerman12/TwitterDataCollector) for Henry's research group, and some sundry research projects together with one of his PhD students, and was praised by other affiliates of his that he recommended me to, at [Bryx emergency response](https://bryx.com). As a result of my skill, combined with appreciation for my extracurricular breadth, Henry accepted me into his PhD group as a doctoral student. 

### Fall, 2018 semester, and the Dead Marshes

- I first injected Dupilumab summer, 2017
- My first semester in the PhD program began in Fall, 2017, with Henry as advisor
- I lived in the [House on May St.](#house-on-may-st) for about a year, when, in 2018, Aetna cut me off from Dupilumab and my hair rapidly fell out
  
After the house on May St., it was from my mom's apartment (in 2018) during a video call with my advisor that I described that biologically-inspired neuron architecture [above](#benzodiazepine-benzos-mechanism-of-action), with the specifics in the [video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1i5hS2iDVuo24PnGicvn5dIZYXUzDfPAl/view?usp=share_link) comparing it to the LSTM architecture.

I also presented a description of the LSTM cell, then layer, then network, then bidirectional layers with attention, to my Semantic Parsing class from the ground up using that [biological formulation](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1i5hS2iDVuo24PnGicvn5dIZYXUzDfPAl/view?usp=share_link). My fellow PhD student told me in our office that it was really original, and she liked how I didn't use the usual LSTM diagram. The class was impressed with me.

I should add that since the house on May St., I was building a Keras-type framework for long-term memory for the Medical Center, including the semester I did my MHDPA innovation paper, that had generalized neural episodic control into a framework that I could use for disease prognostication, novel of course, and which I’d also suggested could be used for interpreting exactly what measurements of a patient’s history informed the model’s predictions, similar to how attention weights might do today. 

Also in that 2018 Fall semester, Henry made me apply for the NSF GRFP, one of the most competitive fellowships in the world. I submitted a personal background and research plan that got [excellent reviews](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/87ef2c97-c1d5-4333-9247-a0d28a689efb), with one of the reviewers writing, "This is exactly the type of high-risk, high-reward research that the NSF is looking for to support." I proposed my long-term episodic memory model, biological neuron, and relational reasoning via MHDPA to feed "relational concepts" into a long-term memory.

As I worked on the NSF GRFP submission, I kept asking the I Ching for advice, in addition to Henry, Sri Pai, and Charles Venuto. The former tended to give the most consistent, helpful answers, and for most of the writing process, very positive and encouraging. By the "former," I mean the I Ching, but the three professors also were encouraging, read my submissions, looked at different drafts, and helped. Their opinions contradicted each other, especially on the choice between two versions of the research plan I wrote, where Henry and Sri, both Computer Science, preferred one, and Charles and someone my age I liked, and I, preferred the other. I ended up going with the one the CS professors preferred. It was more structured and rigorous-looking, but less natural, profound, and lacked as much of a deeper philosophical meaning.

Towards the end of the submission, just when I was ready to submit my final versions, including that structured research plan that the CS professors liked, the I Ching's tone had gotten far more ominous in its answers, consistently, suddenly, no matter what I asked it, whether it was the choice between those versions of the research plan, or different edits I considered or came up with. Its predictions were all negative. I submitted what I had, since the deadline was that day, and the result ended up being a very unfortunate "honorable mention," wherein all of the reviews were excellent, except one "Good" that tilted the scale. The last's reasoning? I didn't have enough paper publications, as he'd ["have expected"](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/87ef2c97-c1d5-4333-9247-a0d28a689efb) from someone with such an interesting submission. Otherwise, it was a good submission, but [without paper publications, he couldn't give me an "Excellent."](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/87ef2c97-c1d5-4333-9247-a0d28a689efb)

It was a lot of work, but concurrently, amid yet-other grad-level courses, I worked on my MHDPA innovation paper, as the semester project for the Semantic Parsing class. Neither Henry nor the professor had heard of MHDPA back then. Henry critiqued my use of the term "relational reasoning" to describe it, now the convention. Dan wrote that I wasn't clear on the math, and needed more equations. The amount of math I used fully described the method and was/is the convention.

But a strong interest or fascination with MHDPA, in 2018, didn't come by accident. Today, people who've heard of MHDPA have heard of it because of transformers, like the kind that underpins ChatGPT. In 2018, even an NLP professor whose students worked with deep learning models, including sequence-to-sequence attention models, as Dan was, was unlikely to have heard of transformers, let alone MHDPA, and of course Henry for that matter, since his background was in symbolic AI, and included little, if any, deep learning experience.
<!-- , and it was notable enough that he was one of the tenured professors in the CS department who believed deep learning wasn't a fad. -->

After the house on May St., I was coming up with and seeking a method that could do relational reasoning in deep learning. That is how I found MHDPA so early, before it had much recognition or almost any application (besides some groups at DeepMind) in the field. I was coming up with my own concept of relationally-attending-to image-features, and researching to find if anything existed in line with those principles, and (after [Relation Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.01427)) I found the other DeepMind applications in [reinforcement learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.01830) and [RNN memory](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.01822), respectively. I was coming up with a relational disentangled-attention type method for use as "relational representations" in a long-term episodic memory, and later how to innovate MHDPA for that purpose, a consideration that led to the innovation I evaluated on a question-answering dataset for my Semantic Parsing semester project, which outperformed the baseline MHDPA. I submitted my [paper](https://www.overleaf.com/read/qgmmzgsrctmg#6cd1b9) to the next year's ICML conference. The reviewers hadn't heard of MHDPA, (dismissively) compared it to other preexisting attention mechanisms (having conflated that with my innovation), and critiqued that I didn't have enough experiments. <!-- Adding experiments, back then though, wasn't so easy, because infrastructures for transformers and those benchmarks didn't exist. I programmed in TensorFlow 1.0 and Sonnet, in 2018. Furthermore, it would have gone deep into-the-weeds of something I wasn't primarily building the method for, so I proceeded with a mix of my own plans, as much bigger obstacles added themselves from the medical system, an unforeseeable change involving Henry's employment, and hugely-intensive demands that followed, not just benzos, but in vast majority consequences from benzos, and by the time transformers exploded, the method lost relevance in a saturated field, and I'd already been put on multiple new intensive projects that I didn't have much choice in. By the time I had a chance, I was now answering much more heavily to an overseeing authority, and tried to find time for other research directions that, unlike my method from 2018, at that point were still looking far ahead beyond where the rest of the research zeitgeist was. I didn't realize for a long time that I was the first to innovate on MHDPA, and that if not for the coercion of benzos, I would have very plausibly gotten credit for it.-->

<!--
Henry and I both didn't have experience with deep learning prior to when I entered the PhD program. Up until that summer before my first year as a PhD student, I had been working with random forest models. I had to teach myself — really quickly —  and through hard-to-believe intuition, the full state of the art and then some as I started the program, as I took grad-level depth and "breadth" courses, none of which at the University of Rochester were especially helpful, and my professors and students around me had very little to offer.

That being said, and most CS students can relate to this: in college, most of what I learned was self-taught. That of course didn't change in the PhD program, as the professors were still bad teachers, except also didn't know anything about the material that would need to be taught, the state of the art of their own fields, yet. 

I'm not trying to be mean to anybody. This is the truth. It's hard to express, because it implies that the world is bad, that people with authority are stupider than they're credited and esteem themselves, that they're not just stupid, but actually really, really, like really stupid, and in vast majority. THAT might make writing and reading this hard. It might make it hard to believe, if you haven't seen this for yourself, as a student. I'd say the same about the other PhD students though. I'd say this about every professor and PhD student who was in the CS department. Not personally, not that they're always stupid, but that, in general, they were. Undergrads maybe see grad students as knowing so much more, but those grad positions, and professorial, don't require intelligence to earn, usually. In most cases, actual intelligence, or anything actually novel, would get in the way.

Most people get into those positions through natural memorization ability, or obsessive memorization, and then make some minor deviations from what was taught to them that they call research, and that combination of memorization and very-linear tinkering gets esteemed if they're able to write it up in the standard academic jargon. That last part — jargon — is most of what academia beyond the memorization-stage requires. Even those professors who make a dent, often get there by luck, usually around a really simple idea sufficiently complicatedly executed.

In med school, the ability to memorize which prescriptions correspond to which diagnoses, and which diagnoses correspond to which symptoms, and which anatomical events correspond to which symptoms, is something ChatGPT-like AIs can pass [exceptionally](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18416), with [even better bedside manner](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-00099-4).
-->

I went to a conference that year, NeurIPS, 2018, in Montreal. At the time it was called "NIPS, 2018." I met the DeepMind researcher Ryan Faulkner, who co-authored the [RNN memory](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.01822) paper, that innovated on the RNN cell by applying internally the MHDPA method, who was so impressed with me, perhaps because of the really-concept-understanding comment I made at his poster session about disentangling something in their memory cell to improve their method (independent to what I'd been researching, completely to do with his method), that he invited me to lunch, and during lunch, as we were talking, he said he would recommend me to a position at DeepMind if I applied, back in 2018. 

I was walking around Montreal with headphones in my ears, listening to Of Montreal by momentum from listening to it by coincidence before the conference, and working, working really hard, in my hotel there. There was a group chat for people visiting for the conference, and lots of social events that I missed. I wanted to go to a hot tub party, but ended up working. I wanted to go to "strip karaoke," but was practicing strict ascetic disciplines, and asked the I Ching. The I Ching gave a resounding no. On the floor of my hotel, I cast the Feng Shui coins, and got the ominous hexagram "Decrease," and to my regret (having never gone to anything like either of those things), I listened, stayed in isolation, and worked. The snow outside was beautiful, and at least I walked from time to time to explore and to get groceries. "Organic" food is apparently called "biologique" in French.

I met Jürgen Schmidhuber in the conference itself, at his talk, was the last in line, had to wait longer than everybody, then talked to him a bit, he was friendly, and he shook my hand. I sent him a followup email, he replied, and it meant a lot to me.

I was wearing a hat all through the conference, to cover up my baldness, that I still wasn't used to, and still am not. It was winter, and the winter hat didn't look too out of place. Early December, less than three weeks before my RGH hospitalization.

The encroaching mental state on the social and self-image-based fronts began its march from the hair loss, in particular [about my confidence about my physical attraction.](https://www.reddit.com/r/socialanxiety/comments/dzx7or/not_to_get_into_toxic_territory_but_sometimes_i/) <!--Can also link: https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/1dyn2es/comment/lce3ie3/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button-->

When I returned, my isolation on the work-based front deepened, as I was getting ready to submit my MHDPA innovation paper, coinciding with my first-ever hospitalization, the second time my frontier research ideas (the earlier alluded to in part in the [House on May St.](#house-on-may-st)) coincided with a sudden major health crisis, either 100% externally caused in the first instance, or unprecedented for me, almost suspiciously so<!--,--> in the second. 

I was also doing yoga, together with meditation and pranayama, every day, intensely and in deep trance through each session, by myself on a yoga mat or the floor, a yoga taught to me through the advanced technique of TM, that was being taught in tandem with a meditation retreat at a zen center I went on, earlier on my 23rd birthday, on November 18, 2018, where one of the instructors actually learned that it was my birthday and brought me cake and got everybody to sing happy birthday for me. It turned out, rather ironically/unfortunately, it was somebody else's birthday that day or weekend, too, who was in the large dining area where the instructor brought me cake, announced to everybody (against my will) that it was my birthday, and they all sang to me, but not to him (not knowing it was his birthday). He later told me at that event<!--, with good humor-->. Most (well, definitely all) of the people there were older than me.

This period was an extremely isolated time of work and esoteric in-the-weeds revelation. Besides stacks of printed academic papers, I was reading The Lord of the Rings, and there was one chapter that I read precisely in this narrow time span (the meditation retreat was a different time span) after I returned from Montreal, "The Passage of the Marshes," that resonated for its eerie imagery. 

Frodo and Sam are being led by Gollum through the Dead Marshes. It's an eerie chapter, as Gollum's world seems to be the ruling one now, and Frodo and Sam are navigating at his back through the boggy peril.

I was going deeper and deeper into a psychotic state, both of (a) brilliant awareness and foresight about my field's fundamental principles and trajectory, and (b) isolation, as if I was traversing by the lead of Gollum through the Dead Marshes.

### <!--Psychosis c-->Crisis

> [!NOTE]
> This was about 5 - 8 months after the hair loss. No prior history of psychosis or mania.

An ambulance found me, wet with brook water<!--, potentially at risk of frostbite-->. The only answer I gave as to what happened, was "for pleasure," here and thereafter, under the delusional belief that my mom's life was in danger if I didn't adhere to that secrecy.

### Rochester General Hospital (RGH)

#### Christmas Eve/Day, 2018

By chance, my psychosis happened from the morning of Christmas Eve to the morning/night of Christmas day, 2018 when the ambulance found me. By chance, since my only reason for doing this, the unspecified <!--self-endangering--> ordeal, was fear that my mom's life was in danger, and whether it was a Christian holiday or not was irrelevant to me since my family is Jewish by ethnicity and was secular. 

My interest in the I Ching began in the House on May St., when I heard of it by chance through hearing again a lecture from [Terence McKenna](https://youtu.be/9E5eBqG0cds?si=AZVe2xQMEci2s7Rr), who I used to enjoy in college. It resonated because of the randomness-dependent theory I had, and I ordered a Richard Wilhelm translation and copy as well as some Feng Shui coins. 

A nurse was there to help thaw my legs to prevent hypothermia and frostbite.  My legs were thawed in some machine and my mom arrived. I was still afraid her life was in danger, but I didn't say anything. I didn't talk much.

The nurse remarked on some damages I had. 

#### Catatonia, or swallowing my tongue sensation

Then in a different bed, while doctors or nurses or attendants were in the room, I felt some strange thing happen with my tongue and throat, like my tongue was going back into it: my mouth opened wide, and it was like I swallowed my tongue, the whole [Kundalini](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kundalini) that had "risen," although actually it was the physical inner sensation that moved through different parts of my body, that in the house on May St., through meditation, I had full control of, acutely — like look in a puppy's eyes — and that I actually brought down consciously, since I found, and still think was, that to be the ideal, more natural state of consciousness. 

I went into a conscious yogic surrender of all muscle due to a command from <!--those--> [yogic grace guidances](#sarah), elaborated on later, to do so, even as the doctors pushed and wheeled my limp body forward to the MRI machine.

Then my sister arrived to the room I was in next, and she saw me, and touched my arm, aware I wasn't unconscious, in contrast to the doctor's or attendant's reassurance.

She said she saw me smile. The doctor or attendant reassured her I was unconscious.

A couple days later, an injection of benzos brought me out of the yogic state sooner than I'd planned to stay in it, as I became carefree to the earlier perceived responsibility. 

### Discharge from RGH

I also gave the "for pleasure" answer to the psychiatrist, who diagnosed me with a bipolar manic episode and catatonia.

> [!NOTE]
> 
> "Bipolar mania" could perhaps be clinically regarded as accurate. "Catatonia" was a misdiagnosis, due to me not knowing the definition of "catatonia," the fear for my mom if I elaborated on what actually happened, the <!--physical--> ability to have exited it, the yogic trance/grace/guidance that I was adhering to only due to fear of my mom dying which is not the same as "catatonia," and the difficulty of articulating what happened so soon after/amid the psychosis in the first place.

I ran the final experiments for my [MHDPA innovation paper](https://www.overleaf.com/read/qgmmzgsrctmg#6cd1b9) within just days of that, fully out of that altered state of consciousness now, in the hospital since the hospital staff allowed my mom to bring my laptop in.

Then RGH discharged me not much more than one week after admission.

More than two weeks since the first hospitalization, I end up not sleeping all night. My sister happened to visit the next day. Due to having not slept all night, she was worried I might be going through another "manic" episode and insisted to my mom and me to drive me to Strong Hospital. The doctors at Strong Hospital didn't question the prior "mania" nor "catatonia" diagnoses, nor ask for any further details about that earlier hospitalization or the <!--preceding--> events.

### The unsampled world at Clover St.

My sister came to our apartment and brought my mom and I to her dark-red mid-size crossover, that I thought looked like a car that symbolized the Devil. Compared to the cars my mom and I drove, it was much newer, much nicer, dark red. She was working as a nurse at the time and making a middle class income. My mom was working two jobs with a low income, and I was a doctoral student.

When we were driving, I remember we stopped at Clover St., due to a red light, and some instinct told me to jump out. The feeling was ominous. But together with that ominous feeling, as the drive progressed, I sensed that a million worlds existed, and that all of them had evolved to converge to this one. So I sat somewhat reassured, in an uneasy anxiety, that what was happening will be okay. 

Except, the sense/vision/idea was wrong, this time. Instead of my fanciful ideas about quantum stochasticity in a single universe, I had this bizarre idea, specifically on this transit, about "Many worlds" — I know, how original. "Many worlds" is a standard interpretation in quantum physics, often an alternative to Copenhagen which also, like me, both usually and <!--I guess--> in my version here, tends to assume a single universe.

In "Many worlds," or at least my version that I was conjuring up in my mind in the car, or I should say was pouring into my mind through a sheer awareness, everything that happened in the universe was evolved, through countless cycles of different trajectories, over cosmogenesis origins upon cosmogenesis origins, into the perfect exact happenings that were happening then. Now that's not really "Many worlds." That's one world, where it just cycles many times, like an AI training algorithm, and we just happen to be in the version that cycled in this way.

"Many worlds" is more nuanced. It says: there's a LOT of worlds — like at least 6. No, maybe a million. No, googolplex. Infinity! Undefined! And we're in this one, because "reasons."

Both of these theories/interpretations are wrong. But neglecting to explain why for now, I think either of these serve as an accessible way to quickly show that, even under a pretty standard physics interpretation, the possibility of "God" is not... I think the word I want to use is "not necessarily stupid."

I mentioned stochasticity in the universe's quantum mechanics. That means randomness. The universe, as it's theorized today, is fundamentally probabilistic. And physics does a great job of telling us that those probabilities are probabilities. No no, just look at Schrödinger's quantum wave function. See, it's a bunch of probability densities that splash around like a kiddie pool. And when those waves are especially high, that's where the particle is more likely to get sampled, or that's the more likely velocity of the particle, or that's the more likely "World" that gets sampled, or in my especially terrible vision, that's the "Cycle" that the universe just permanently converges to forever. 

So where can "God" fit into any of those interpretations, besides the last one being just "Godawful," no-pun-unintended (my puns are deterministic)? Well, ultimately, something has to select which world gets chosen. One way that could happen is through just the magic power of randomness. Another way, is that some *will* known as "statistical divergence" is able to allocate the probable from the improbable, and, within its holy bounds, tilt the scales a bit. The "Sampler" — who is the "Sampler"?

I sensed an ominous feeling as we were driving, and that same inner sense that gave me that kind-of vision about the many cycling-evolving worlds converging to this moment's exact perfection, told me to make a run for it when we stopped at Clover St., at a red light. My doctoral advisor, Henry, actually lived on Clover St.

My sister's car was big and red, like a giant Dirt Devil, and before we got into it, I immediately had the "Devil" association, appear like a fear in my mind, the first omen (ominous sense) of that drive. Well, the "Sampler" that was about to sample my fate could only have been a little red vacuum cleaner, because, this transit, not specifically just this transit but this transit as well, was taking me to Hell, and the Devil drive did not end on Clover St., nor on the hospital grounds. No, each ticking moment from the drive to the psychiatric unit, even back to home, was a cruise controlled, speed-limit-obeying, insidious, maybe even pleasant drive, deeper, into Hell, to a Hell of mind that only one door leaves.

But at this time, we were stopped on Clover St. And there was my doctoral advisor's big house, on this street, that I could've, hypothetically, run to, in one of the many other worlds. 

My advisor, Henry Kautz, was the most successful man I knew, and his house, I <!--thought-->think, was a mansion (though honestly the one I had on May St. probably would've been preferable).

As my sister must've thought, I'd be getting just standard quality care. What a lucky day. What a lucky world that was sampled. And then we proceeded, from Clover St., to the first day of my benzo nightmare. 

### University of Rochester's Strong Hospital

#### Sarah

After the Christmas, 2018 trauma, I wasn't able to access my meditation anymore. The mystical phenomenon I physically sensed was stunted. Those Kundalini sensations, and the complete transcendence of my psyche, stopped. 

It was like the breath that had been passing through my system had gotten locked into some bigger entity, that was asymmetrical, overly strong, and just leaning to one side. 

> [!NOTE]
> I felt, ever since that sensation that my tongue was going back into my throat, some vestibular situation — something really changed, and has been different since. That oceanic feeling that John Lennon captured really well about his experiences with TM in the song ["Across the Universe"](https://youtu.be/90M60PzmxEE?si=2n0PJKmeekYA6etl) ([John Lennon wrote the song about TM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Across_the_Universe#Composition), both explicitly in his reference to "Jai guru deva om" and more ambiguously with his spot-on description of the state of consciousness induced by and, with respect to the mantra, during, TM) was gone. Since that "catatonia" (tongue-throat situation), my experiences/words during and following TM weren't "like endless rain into a paper cup." They had become coarse somehow, and instead of that vibrant "Kundalini" movement I felt before, there was a physical feeling in my neck, a right-angle tilt, even when I wasn't meditating. I first began noticing this while trying to meditate in the hospital at RGH.

The meditation still relaxed me. I still felt less social anxiety afterwards. It still gave my thoughts more peace. But physically, it felt neither like bliss nor like a body part that I directly controlled. I couldn't maneuver the breath, kundalini, blood circulation, whatever it was, through the different areas of my physical psyche (and actual body), and my given mantra, that I repeated silently in my mind as part of the meditation, didn't carry itself to the same places of <!--silent--> acuity that it naturally did before, where rather than the hard sensation of speaking my inner voice that now characterizes my mantra's audition, the mantra had before "tapped," "dissolved," become so soft until it literally couldn't be heard except in awareness and all of my thoughts were then fully adherent to both my will and my natural rhythm, and no energy was lost no matter how verbosely or viscerally I thought then, and each one came like ["endless rain into a paper cup,"](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&opi=89978449&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Across_the_Universe%23:~:text%3DThe%2520flavour%2520of%2520the%2520song,the%2520link%2520to%2520the%2520chorus.&ved=2ahUKEwjGvszQ1rOIAxXlhIkEHdwgLcwQFnoECBsQAw&usg=AOvVaw1MtnfbSbXSsMu_w1lg6V_v) where just the right word, or visual or association, corresponded to both my will and my rhythm, beautifully, sometimes blissfully, sometimes catastrophically, maybe even orgasmically. It was on that plane of consciousness, that I probably can't do justice in describing, with words from that consciousness, [that I even happened to have written that MHDPA innovation paper.](https://www.overleaf.com/read/qgmmzgsrctmg#6cd1b9) 

[People mention the "inner monologue" vs. other types of thinking debate](https://www.iflscience.com/people-with-no-internal-monologue-explain-what-its-like-in-their-head-57739). That is a good analogy to the kind of consciousness transition I did while meditating, where my thoughts had become increasingly more acute, and were at the end, both. Both an awareness independent of words and words that perfectly matched that awareness, no matter how deep or intricate, then. And the awareness itself could carry far more information, and with each word (like ["endless rain into a paper cup"](https://youtu.be/90M60PzmxEE?si=2n0PJKmeekYA6etl)) less energy was used and no exhaustion would arise.

Now, some big lump pushed to the right of my throat and perhaps into my head, that same moving fist that was once an acute breath which circulated my chest, back, and head (or heart, back of throat, trachea/third-eye region/head).
 
The change began in RGH, not during the yogic state. The change began after they injected me with something, rapidly changed the fine balance of my body's energies, and overwhelmed the sensitivity of a delicate state of consciousness with a much harder, much stronger, much less acute hospital one. The sudden change, including environmental and neurological, as they also "snapped me out" of that state rapidly with the injection of benzos, perhaps broke some endocrine or vestibular system of chakras and Kundalini that is unknown to (modern) science and medicine, locking my throat (maybe third eye or crown) "chakra" in some way that I since haven't been able to unlock, again, in the same way. An Adam's Apple, now lodged in my throat (and upper head, *maybe* nose/lobe region), like I choked on the wisdom that the higher nature forces gave me, from my earliest meditation days, up to the inexplicable rapid psychosis when I was finishing up my [MHDPA paper](https://www.overleaf.com/read/qgmmzgsrctmg#6cd1b9) in 2018.
 
Part of what makes thoughts expressive through words is the intuitive feeling of some words as capturing the meaning and evoking some sense of the meaning. The brain makes those associations, and the faster it does so in line with our own will and rhythm, the more harmonious the mental state feels. But its suggestions can also take a life of their own, and after the House on May St., I found I was listening to intuitions that pointed to less rationalizable actions, with the awareness of their physical, visceral appearance in my consciousness and psyche; and so, in tandem with the profoundness of my research and research realizations, about long-term memory, relational reasoning and MHDPA, stochasticity in physics, there was no rational doubt that some profound consciousness phenomenon was being unlocked in tune with the context of what I was studying, and that gave that phenomenon — those intuitions and physical observations — unusual, perhaps even unprecedented, credibility. And I increasingly obeyed the guidance of them, less with my own intent, and more with the adherence to their "grace," their "wind," their threat. 
 
Additionally, I was using the I Ching, and the I Ching gave extraordinarily precise answers, answers that were too specific and relevant to be accident. In Rorschach tests, a person looks at ink blots and tells the psychoanalyst their associations. Dream interpretations are similar. But the answers I was getting from the I Ching weren't just associatively relevant. They were specific, consistent, and profound. 

So besides a consciousness component, I interpreted physical phenomena to be happening in the universe's physics, as I'd theorized earlier about the intelligence of quantum sampling. So not only did I have the visceral phenomena, and the intelligence research studies, but also direct answers from a randomness-dependent query book, and a rational mechanism for how such discriminatory actual interventions in the universe — while still respecting the predictable laws of physics currently known/modeled — could be possible. 

> [!NOTE]
> Is the I Ching really "randomness-dependent?" Well, it depends on decisions involving yarrow stalks or the casting of Feng Shui coins. Small-but-nonnegligible probabilistic divergences are hypothesized in quantum particles, which can bias physical matter collisions, and might have an evolved limited interplay in a person's consciousness with neurology/physiology, perhaps less limited depending on yogic attunement, thereby to some degree a person's physical motor activity. That of course raises many other questions, [that might have their own possible answers.](Philosophy/Consciousness.md)
 
That made the threats infinitely times more convincing, and as I transitioned from the House on May St., where I had independence and self respect, to my apartment without hair, without eyebrows and eyelashes, with even my fingernails purple and bending out of my nails, and social isolation and heavy workloads, including auxiliary ones that my advisor made me do like applying to the NSF GRFP (for which I got a "honorable mention," all excellent reviews, later after all this, one of them even writing, ["This is exactly the type of high-risk, high-reward research that the NSF is looking for to support,"](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/87ef2c97-c1d5-4333-9247-a0d28a689efb) except one that gave me a "good" instead of "excellent" because I didn't have any publications to back up the peer-reviewed credibility of the research I was proposing, research that was about long-term memory primarily, but also relational reasoning and persistent memory), the "vibe" of my status as a person was marginalizing and "Gollum-esque," as I hid in a cave essentially, my last hairs dropping from my head, and worked. 
 
That "vibe" then commanded me in different ways. Rather than a social energy (or, I should write, "self-respecting energy," since I wasn't too social in the House on May St. either, and was also working really hard, but in a wealthier surroundings, with park and nearby nature and magical-cat-visitor and antiqueness in the aesthetic, to boot), the creativity of the energy went towards work, and the rest of it gradually became something else. I don't want to describe it as anxiety. The anxiety appeared later, on that Christmas, 2018 day when I thought my mom was going to die, but until then it was beautiful, scary, but beautiful. 

> [!NOTE]
>
> I lived with guilt for this psychosis for a long time, for years, and now I'm actually proud, because it proved my bravery when my mom's life is at threat, or when a responsibility — in particular, from whatever probable forces somehow, and not trivially, convinced me — is perceived.

It was literally a wind that pushed me into the woods. 

I had left my apartment thinking my heightened energies were draining my mom, and walked through the snow aimlessly, but adhering to senses and what I thought were yogic grace guidances, to make a distance from her. Then I reached a road near the more commercial district, and then I turned towards the woods direction, and last second, I saw a man coming out of his car, and I shouted "Hey!" and I asked him if he had gloves, and he did and he gave them to me. 

Then, still not knowing I was going into the woods, a wind pushed me. A wind blew and I walked into those woods where I sat, in meditative silence, and peace, near a prettier part of the brook, thinking I had to stay there for a week, and if I did, my mom wouldn't die. 

And I stayed there, completely immune to the cold, but protected, physiologically, by a single coat, sweatpants, and those gloves that were given me. 

Somehow, from the moment I'd left my apartment door, to the rest of this venture, except for a health concern, the cold didn't feel too cold. My body, in this energy state, adapted so well. Humans have evolved mostly in the Ice Age. I cannot tell you the medical implications of how much power the body has. I was there, from the early morning I left to the rest of the day, in the cold, that through this extreme, psychotic/delusional, transcendent energy state didn't faze me in the slightest, didn't bite the way cold is thought to supposed to, and it varied — you see, every disobedience to the guidance of my energy state resulted in a physical grasp of me by the cold; I would shiver and shake, at increasingly extreme levels the more I stopped adherence. But as soon as I returned to adherence, the cold and the shaking stopped. 

This is not trivial. This reproducibly felt like a physical relationship between me and the cold, where had I disobeyed the exact adherence of my psychic state, the particles of the cold would (or I should say "did") get me. The shaking then wouldn't even vary. It would appear in exact increment proportion to my deviation from the adherence to that mental state. 

Still daylight, the meaning of ["Life is suffering,"](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/the-second-noble-truth/201609/existence-is-suffering) as it's colloquially said that the Buddha had said, decryptified to me: "Life itself, the source and the living, is currently suffering, in the world." I imagined grass dying as a symbolism for this interim worldly state of things. "Life is suffering," however, is not a permanent state or law of nature. It is the ongoing situation of life in the world.

It was at night, near 2 AM, 3 AM, or 4 AM when that terrible peace turned into a different kind of panic.

> [!NOTE]
> The brook-jumping "baptism" could be interpreted as spiritual birth/rebirth, the throat sensations and tongue swallowing perhaps as Kundalini "rising," characterized in Hinduism as "spiritual awakening." Others independently describe [psychosis-type symptoms in Kundalini awakening](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9460011/), in Hindu tradition. The "yogic grace guidances," I'd interpreted, since the House on May St., as Tao. 

The I Ching had called those disruptions, the guidances that were navigating me, "Grace." And in Taoist philosophy, "Grace" isn't necessarily good. Those winds, as they push us, are, to put it in Richard Wilhelm's words, "beauty in form," and in the I Ching's taxonomy, such a state to a person's psyche and cosmology "has success in small matters […] but he dare not decide controversial issues in this way."

> [!NOTE]
> The I Ching gave this answer exactly the morning of the day before the Christmas Eve one that I left my apartment.

Perhaps this is what I was supposed to learn from the betrayal in my mind's newly activated much-deeper-more-acute-intense intuitions. However, I suspect maybe something else as the mechanism, something in the collective/societal consciousness, something that brought "Grace," as my work actualized into a paper and my body came to look ever more like Gollum's — from extreme intelligence to extreme stupidity.

> Possible edit 1: People become more suggestible (e.g., to consciousness forces) when they are in lower social stations, as it is in higher social stations where they are in more of a control attitude towards their enigmas. Yet the fact that I was producing that paper perhaps adds a different dimension to this consideration, one that suggests that a person’s own self-perception, e.g., via one area of the brain, can contradict that attitude of another one, perhaps a societal consciousness one, such as, and this is just my hypothesis, the Broca’s and Wernicke’s areas, respectively. These two areas are crucial for language, which requires both one’s individual self emulation, and relations of self as influenced by societal ones. In other words, the Broca’s area is the genuine self-expression, and the Wernicke’s area regulates for social symbiosis, perhaps with social emulations and “mixture of experts,” even “Gods” one could metaphorically call them. An actor and critics, in a way, but one need not necessarily optimize another. Too severe a dissociation though can lead to psychosis maybe, and in my case, my relationship memory perhaps could not afford the views of me that I myself was building towards rationally, where I think that “mixture of experts” from the Wernicke’s area comes from relationship memory, and maybe archetypal “experts” as well. And “psychosis” might not be the right characterization furthermore, if “spiritual journeys” are themselves specific processes of relationship memory, and/or other intelligent systems. I even hypothesize that the phonetics of the words brought about by the former can be modulated in the resonance of their pronunciation by the latter, so as to change both the resonance of the conscious communication and the semantics of the sub/super-conscious one, and going further than that, but I’ll leave this hypothesis sketched in these high level specific terms for now.

The trachea, or the cartilage above it, the Adam’s apple, I hypothesize has a bigger role in the phonetic regulation for biological men than biological women, in adherence with power structures governing via the Wernicke area.

In my second hospitalization, the environment was much better than RGH's. I made friends with Sarah, Hudson, and other inpatients. We [played](https://youtu.be/cco_DvSzrts?si=pmfrQ4XEaLF1teEK&t=51) Guitar Hero together, there was a piano, there were TVs, one of the public rooms had big windows, we even were taken across floors of the hospital for music jamming sessions with lots of instruments, they had their yoga and meditation instructions as well, and of all of my hospitalizations to come, this was perhaps the best care unit I was gated by armored vault into. 

Sarah's sister's name is "Kundalini Grace." I hadn't heard of "Kundalini" until after I had those visceral, physical sensations in the House on May St. Then I looked up those sensations I was experiencing and found, for the first time, not having heard the word or of those movements and sensations before, the term "Kundalini," made more credible to me by the philosophy's appreciation by the depth psychologist Carl Jung, who I was reading at the time, and whose views, very distinct from Freud's, on the existence of a subconscious, and its mystical-transcendent connection, helped explain some of what I was witnessing.  

Sarah Young's last name is "Jung," she hadn't heard of Carl Jung, she and I kept observing synchronicities while we were there, and she kept a synchronicity list. To me, no synchronicities happened yet that were bigger than just the uncanny precision and specificity of the I Ching's answers. However, I was still seeing some unambiguous synchronicities, as well as not seeing many others, including that the word "synchronicity" was actually coined by Jung, and now I was remarking on them  together with one Sarah "Jung." But there were more I hadn't seen, and more, much bigger, that would come.

The House on May St., in retrospect was one big synchronicity. I got the Facebook student housing page moderatorship just before I had to move out, and was able to deliver on my promise to fill my landlord's house (and houses) with grad students. Not to mention, the house itself. Having that whole house, pretty much to myself, a beautiful antique house, for relatively pennies, the same house I had my AI and physics revelations — "luck" seems to forget a lot of context.

So the word "synchronicity" was already familiar, as was Jung, as was Kundalini, as was Grace, by the time Sarah and I met in the hospital. 

<!--

We played Guitar Hero, I continued all of my meditation and yoga regimen, and my family, including my mom, uncle and aunt, and cousin brought in Paleo diet food for me, which I ate for my eczema but which also helped with my cognition, instead of the unhealthy processed type food of the hospital. And I shared crapes with Sarah<!--(another inpatient)-->, that my aunt brought in each time she and my uncle visited. They weren't 100% Paleo (buckwheat, goat cheese), but still delicious.

So to summarize, I was doing daily meditation, twice a day, daily yoga each morning, and eating a Paleo diet in the hospital, as well as now socializing well. On top of all of that, and antipsychotics, surely the missing ingredient to cure me would be an involuntary >6 months course of benzos.

My brother-in-law came in with my sister and I explained to him relational reasoning and the paper I submitted, the method of MHDPA. I explained to him the method underlying ChatGPT from my hospital ward 4 years before ChatGPT. And at the time, he thought my explanation was cool, but it'd've been hard to predict would be such a big thing, one that others in my field and the world would have heard of or have anywhere to as much belief in the utility in AI of, in the near-term or in the years to come. It was hard to predict for my professors and faculty, too. At the time, 2018/early-2019, most at the University of Rochester still thought deep learning was a fad. None of the professors or other PhD students were doing research on MHDPA, let alone had heard of MHDPA. [They might claim otherwise](4-Faith.md#academia--medicine). Besides the paper that proposed MHDPA itself, my innovation to MHDPA, was the first innovation to MHDPA ever, in the world/history. A small handful of others applied it, from research groups in DeepMind, none literally innovated *on* the method.

I showed my MHDPA innovation paper to Sarah. She was amazed that she could read it since usually, she said, that kind of stuff isn't readable, and brought up one more synchronicity. Her mom was a writer who had a published short story in a Stephen King anthology, a writer of horror. I was indeed in a hospitalization that was like a pretty good short story in an otherwise Stephen King anthology/horror. 

> [!NOTE]
> Sarah was early 20s, by chance hospitalized at the same time as me, also early 20s. She was a year older. That wasn't common.

Not that my lucidity needed further evidence, but I explained the methods of late-2022 ChatGPT to inpatient and visitors, in early-February, Winter, 2019, while drugs were altering and innovating on the functioning of my biological neural networks.

#### Hudson

Our other companion was Hudson, who caught me as I was being discharged and handed me this letter in an envelope, that I opened later from my apartment:

<p align="center">

</p>

It's great<!--I'm impressed--> he was able to write at all. He had depression, was in the hospital for depression, was being treated for depression, was medicated for depression, and was electroshocked weekly, for depression. 

Meanwhile, I was being brain damaged by benzos, but who could've known that? (I did, because I made the case articulately, sufficiently so, to all of my psychiatrists. As I predicted, longer-term benzo use is dangerous, causes extreme physical dependence, and can result in unthinkable suffering). 

I was told a court order would be acquired if I didn't take them, even as I was taking antipsychotics.

> [!NOTE]
> ### Jeremiah
>
> I ordered a margarita in a 2016 birthright Israel trip (a program that I really like, since otherwise I might've not been able to afford to go on any vacations), with Jeremiah probably somewhere at the table, thinking I was ordering a drink, and they brought me just this big margherita pizza. That's a fun story. Combined with benzos, that is, if I took my prescription for social anxiety that day, I suppose the effect would've been worse, neurologically and physically, than if they brought me a margarita.
>
> That was also the trip where I was complaining [my hair was too long](https://www.facebook.com/share/qQqsQLv4Cgvbv7UZ/) (as many people heard/"witnessed"), perhaps another almost-preternatural-seeming omen, besides the electric razor breaking, that preceded the [very vivid nightmare that I had](#part-1) and me growing out my facial hair (beard and mustache) for the first time, by chance.
>
> And we all got extremely sick, suddenly, everyone on our bus, 10 plus people, 10 - 30 people, originating from a guy on the trip who wasn't me or Jeremiah. My cousin Irina, who went with me, and I, got the most sick, of the whole bus, really severe fever, sneezing, sinuses, coughing, vomiting, more. I recall she was even prescribed an opioid, besides Sudafed.
>
> About two years after my first Strong Hospital hospitalization, Jeremiah, who I hadn't seen since the trip to Israel, commented on a Facebook post that I'd made about the trauma that benzos induced on me, about some of his experiences. He wrote publicly on my post about how some psychiatric medication he had to take caused him to have a seizure. "[...] I've had bad side effects from medications that caused me to have a seizure one time that was no fun. [...]" Benzos, one of the drugs he was prescribed and the only plausible culprit of the ones he told me, [cause seizures during the brain's GABA downregulation](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21815323/#:~:text=Withdrawal%20seizures%20have%20occurred%20with,time%20and%20at%20high%20doses.), a widely suffered and standardly known side effect of longer-term benzo use. Those were almost definitely the medication <!-- of his--> he was referring to.
>
> He also wrote how he was held down and choked, on pavement outside, after being tackled, on the hard rough pavement, by the university-hospital police officers, when he tried to make a run for it. "I tried to escape and they held me down and choked me. I got to the driveway [...]" Analogously, my next hospitalization also involved combative resistance to hospitalization, following the >year of benzo-induced torture. In October, 2020, I was also physically coerced by the police, due to having a "breakdown," I suppose it can be called — quiet, peaceful, and spiritually-guided — in the grass of my apartment complex, where I'm pretty sure I was legally allowed to, or within perimeters. Efforts to escape medical custody might have other causes besides bravery and spirituality (if one is willing to extend the benefit of the doubt that I'm not stupid), for example (1) induced by disinhibitions from prescribed pharmaceutical drugs, or (2) the quality of the care provided within medical custody, or other snowballing longer-term medical-institution causes, such as (3) resistance due to earlier trauma from a previous medical intervention, like the benzo coercion that traumatized me. So, in consequence, the medical application of police brutality can result as one of the negative side effects of a pharmaceutical drug, wherein the medical system is committing physical violence in order to reinforce the drug, care, or practice that led to their own physical violence or the patient's combative resistance. They also are very coercive inside the hospital, especially in the early transit before the psychiatric unit, e.g., making you sit in one place, wear what they want you to wear, take the drugs they give you or otherwise be injected with them, etc.

### Flying colors

The first psychiatrist and I walked together in the hall and he thought I was bright. The social lubricant of benzos gave me a visibly colorful brilliance that I think he reacted to as authoritative, about my knowledge of benzos and intelligence. Let's call this luminescence "flying colors," a term I'm borrowing from Henry. The first psychiatrist said I'd be weaned off before the discharge, and that was the schedule. I was able to articulate colorfully to him with an intimate/earnest social charm that I wanted to be weaned off from the drugs before discharge. He reassured, I would be weaned off before discharge.

The second psychiatrist, an Asian woman, looked stern and astute, came in on the momentum of her previous post, and without much thought just changed the schedule. She was standing next to the first psychiatrist, who hesitantly, self-doubtingly told her that he'd planned to taper me off before the discharge since I was worried, but she was dismissive, about the original plan and our preferances in that regard. She said the tapering schedule was too fast and the outpatient doctor, the psychiatrist after the hospitalization, would wean me off, but this time, she gave the reassurance, to me, that I'd be tapered right after discharge.

They didn't question if the diagnoses, in particular "catatonia," were actually what I went through. I didn't know the specific definition of catatonia, which is what the benzos were meant to treat, but adherence to yogic-type senses, delusional or not, safe to intervene on with drugs or not, isn't the same as catatonia. The other diagnosis from the medical record was "bipolar mania," for which I was being given Risperdals, a strong antipsychotic.

To explain that or anything to them, the pressure was higher with each subsequent psychiatrist because my "flying colors" were increasingly faded, turned to fiery pain. The preceding trauma took the last 5 years for me to process into a form that I could write, let alone speak, let alone boil down into a spoonful under pressure. Depending on which version of this book you are reading, that crisis might not be described at all, here.

<!--
I wasn't asked what happened to me. It was as if "catatonia" and "bipolar mania" were the only description needed, indubitably exhaustive. Were I asked, I'm not sure I'd have been able to explain it to them, necessarily. The preceding trauma took the last 5 years for me to process into a form that I could write, let alone speak, let alone boil down into a spoonful under pressure, and the pressure was higher with each subsequent psychiatrist because my "flying colors" were increasingly faded. Depending on which version of this book you are reading, that crisis might not be described at all, here.
-->

None of the previous diagnoses from the first hospitalization, none of what RGH wrote, were investigated or asked about in any extent by the University of Rochester's psychiatrists<!--, nor were either of them precisely true (at least "catatonia"). None of the events were inquired about more than what was known by RGH (essentially just the two diagnoses, as perceived)-->.

After I was discharged, the color film had faded, the "flying colors" had faded. It was Oz in reverse. The psychiatric unit was the "Wonderful Land of Oz," with me colorfully drunk on the magic benzos they were giving me at threatened risk of court order, and by the third "healer's" pen click, the tornado had begun. The third psychiatrist, the outpatient doctor, also University of Rochester, was categorically, unallegorically bad. If there could be a DSM-5 yellow-brick-manual definition for bad, it would just be a picture of him. In the second month with him, 3 months into the benzos, my cognition was not just grey but Requiem For A Dream-grey, anxiety constant. [My memory, speech, and imagination were gone](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/316ec47a-248e-4141-9eb7-5888bc1ea93d). From his disbelieving clinical authority, all of my symptoms were, wrongly, attributed to the earlier diagnoses. I told him I thought I was brain damaged, and that I was in physical pain, that I had [tinnitus](https://www.reddit.com/r/kundalini/comments/j1finq/tinnitus_in_just_left_ear/), and that I'd read from multiple scientific studies that [brain damage from benzos may be permanent](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10309976/), and he didn't care about the scientific studies I may have hypothetically read, because every word I said was devoid of believability — not colorless from outside, but agitated/irky/murky, like my inner anxiety was attacking him. So he reacted by saying that increasing the dose would be the best course of action. I begged him to taper, and he said if I was having all those negative symptoms, that he should increase the dose, which I had to submit my position on, out of fear that he would. 

I was in cognitive decline by the second psychiatrist. The euphoria was turning into grey cloud and fog, more cognitive impairment, anxiety, excruciating anxiety, and [a constant rightward spinning sensation](https://www.reddit.com/r/kundalini/comments/h8n3ve/lopsided_and_slanted_kundalini_sensations/), which persisted for more than a year.

He wanted to increase the dose, as if that would reduce my brain's increasing system-wide downregulation of GABA, rather than worsen its effort to fight the dysregulation. In case you're wondering, he was an idiot. The brain damage, and literally — when memory, speech, and imagination are all impaired, and the patient's in pain, *the brain is damaged* — risked being permanent and irreversible, according to [(many) studies](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15762814/) I found and the [fact that nobody understands neurodegeneration](https://bmcmedicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12916-024-03437-5). 

I write this with the same truth value as "the Holocaust was bad": I should've weaned myself off then, or better yet, immediately, as soon as I could've started weaning. The brain's GABA being downregulated is like living in an active war zone. Coercively induced, it is, without exaggeration, a legalized form of torture, neurochemical waterboarding, except the effect persists beyond each cranium drowning, without a moment's break for air. By the next month with that doctor, around month 4 of the benzos, I wasn't able to recall well even important personal memories or easily do basic math, grey cognition, non-stop anxiety, non-stop torture. My writing quality went extremely down on anything that was social or creative or new. What I suffered was physiologically brain damage. 

I saw him for about 4 or 5 months and don't remember his name, my cognition was so greyed.

My cognition and perception deteriorated severely, and [a constant rightward spinning sensation](https://www.reddit.com/r/kundalini/comments/h8n3ve/lopsided_and_slanted_kundalini_sensations/), [tinnitus](https://www.reddit.com/r/kundalini/comments/j1finq/tinnitus_in_just_left_ear/), mouth dryness, and [wrinkles](https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/1dyn2es/comment/lce3ie3/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) added to the mounting evidence of damages happening not just to my psyche, but to my brain and body. I was in severe pain and agony. He responded with only authority, no reasoning, and no sensitivity. He didn't believe any of my arguments. He made no consideration to the possibility that I was right or he was wrong. His clinical authority meant more to him than my agony. His perpetuation and amplification of my suffering, attributed reasons (despite good arguments that I made, but which were too agitated for the foolish authority), and fears was afforded to him only by his disbelief and my drug-induced insecurity about weaning off by myself. The third psychiatrist, is like Schindler's List-grey, like not even a little girl carrying an umbrella. <!--I saw him for about 4 or 5 months and don't remember his name, which is too bad, or I would write it here in capital letters.-->

## Area exam (and all As)

As I was working on my area exam, in the Spring 2019 semester, a big 60-ish page paper, amid the first months of the course of benzos, as my cognition was fading and world was gray, but not yet at my most severe, my uncle told me, "step by step." Each day I worked, a little at a time.

It's the hardest thing, to describe how I can get all As and do extraordinarily well in a semester under the conditions I described earlier. That is what my family is like.

<!-- [TO DO:: Add Henry quote from interview about worrying about AI being like "worrying about traffic regulation on Mars"] --><!-- I'm the martian, perhaps who will undergo a hard "execution"] -->

I taught Henry "sequence-to-sequence attention" from my office, in a state of misery that I couldn't convey, as I was also working on further innovations to MHDPA, now suffering due to grad-level classes, TAship, impending area exam, and the brain damage. I tried to tell Henry what was going on and he couldn't understand the severity, giving me an anecdote about his son's medication.

I was building a vision transformer for generalizing across Sonic the Hedgehog levels, but I didn’t realize it was a vision transformer (in the computer vision domain) since it was purely applied to reinforcement learning, and the crux of it for me was to use disentangled relational representations as queries to the episodic memory, meant to give the episodic memory more generalizability since the relational representations extracted parts and their relations rather than the full entangled context, effectively treating the MHDPA heads like an ensemble of independent memory queries using my disentangling method from my earlier paper. This is still an extremely insightful symbolic understanding of how models can generalize across domains, where the relational representations are the generalizable components and the episodic memory was like the parameterized or recurrently-stored knowledge trained into models today via giant data corpora, except in both cases more explicitly programmed in as novel inductive biases. None of this was appreciated by my department, whatsoever. 

Henry during my benzo brain damage edited down the MHDPA innovation paper for me into a workshop paper to submit it to that, and it was rejected one more time. He cut some pages from it to bring it down to the workshop paper length, did his best, and I really appreciated and appreciate it, despite the compounding circumstances slipping that opportunity ever further from away from me, as I myself, like Henry, now doubted that the paper really had value, plus couldn't think or will myself more than I was.

I spent every day of that semester writing a little bit towards my area exam paper. I also had grad-level classes that I had to pass after being hospitalized during the early part of that semester, and amid the benzos that were causing the symptoms of my decreasing cognition described earlier. I got extensions for one class, help from another PhD student on one or two problems for the homework and with understanding material from another class, and visited one of the professors at his office hours for help as I was running late due to the hospitalization. I scored straight As. This<!--, area exam work, and research--> took spirit and luck, as well as my continued disciplines, including daily meditation, strict Paleo diet, cold showers, and Wim Hof method; and asceticisms, including no movies, TV shows, etc., human spirit that should not be underestimated, yes, amid brain damage and torture.

I passed my area exam, for which I had to write that 60ish page paper amid those courses and research, within a few weeks of the close of the Spring, 2019 semester, "with flying colors" according to Henry.

Henry, compared to other professors of similar rank ([one of the highest in the world in AI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Kautz)) and background (symbolic reasoning, or, more fittingly to this book, perhaps, ["worst-case"](https://henrykautz.com) problems), deserves credit for not thinking deep learning was a fad, and had some intuition about ideas like the biologically-inspired neuron in the diagram [above](#benzodiazepine-benzos-mechanism-of-action), though not always of involved ideas, like the use of attention mechanisms (e.g., MHDPA). The person who will be my next advisor (see ["Red light at Clover St. (advisor leaves)"](#red-light-at-clover-st-advisor-leaves)), was my machine vision professor from my first year, Chenliang Xu, technically not in the room during the area exam, and was answering the Skype call from China. He was the only person in the meeting who asked for elaboration on how I planned to do "relational representations" for vision with image features from a CNN, since he didn't know what MHDPA was (neither did my NLP professor in the semester before my hospitalization) and I went back to slide 11 and re-described MHDPA to all of them again, and the fact that Chenliang was the only one of them who showed interest in the method that most revolutionized the next years of their fields, is a synchronicity, because, due to causes that were independent from the area exam, he will become my later advisor (see ["Red light at Clover St. (advisor leaves)"](#red-light-at-clover-st-advisor-leaves)).  

The other faculty were probably mostly impressed by my "flying colors," as my personality was made vibrant by the benzos I had to take at a higher dose that day to function, but that’s not how Henry meant it.

[My slides for that area exam were also quite colorful](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1LK0urIs8yu_e7HyZ-VQoDJUiGpPeTPEUgfhjK5Kw_7w/edit?usp=sharing), also not how Henry meant it.

At the area exam, I presented word by word as I rehearsed. I rehearsed that area exam in front of my mom and uncle for a week every day before the area exam. My mom and uncle knew I was going to take benzos that day at a higher dose. That was the plan. I even rehearsed one day in front of them at an irregular dose, not as high, to test first that it helped. They also knew. That was also the plan. (And, by the way, benzos were originally prescribed to me for social anxiety, more severe than ever amid the grey cognition under the extreme GABA downregulation they induced). That was one of two occasions during my greater-than-yearlong benzo hellmouth and hellfire that I had to take an irregular dose of benzos to do something, the other being [the poster presentation for the Med Center](#charles-venuto)<!--, since that also involved cognitive performance in front of down-looking authorities in a higher-pressure requirement with no other non-risky choice. Backtracking to main timeline..--> later, where at the conference I presented my website and prototype, that I had to build while under all of these work, hellmouth, and hellfire conditions, that they liked, all were impressed by, hired a team for, and didn't credit me.

My uncle was worried I wouldn't pass, and we all celebrated joyfully that I did. The area exam is the University of Rochester CS department's PhD program's biggest defense other than the thesis. Students are awarded a master's degree for a successful area exam defense, which includes the 60ish-page paper and oral defense<!--, which in my case included many faculty,--> that I did. What it took was my earlier stock of genius, and through an extremely dedicated human spirit fighting literal brain damage on will alone, I wrote a genius paper that probably none of them read, and took a big dose of benzos to present it, passing with "flying colors" officially a master's student at extreme torture, Spring, 2019, celebrating uncharacteristically high afterwards. 

My family besides me also have higher-level degrees. My mom, a master's degree in music theory. My uncles Slava and Sasha, PhDs, in physics and mathematics, respectively. My cousins, PhDs in dermatology and pharmacology. My sister, nurse practitioner (master's degree). And my best friend, also in a PhD program (immunology) but in another city. All were proud of me. None knew all the details of the hospitalizations. Henry of course didn't either. This book is the real-time processing of that memory and the rest of these memories, all traumatic and extremely hard to write (see the number of commits this book has, look through the commits to see how hard I struggled to express any of this, and other versions of this book in other repos and on my other GitHubs, maybe that I will make private, where some of this effort to describe and editing also took place), into writing.

## Hell

At after the 6 month point, I gradually reduced the dose, now entering the ["hungover" chemical waterboarding phase](https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/cksl7u/health_disaster_brain_damage_alopecia_universalis/).

Starting some months [(maybe 4th month) into taking the benzos](https://www.reddit.com/r/benzorecovery/comments/cdmid6/is_extreme_brain_fog_normal_before_even_beginning/), before I began weaning, I was laying on the couch, immobilized, shaking with excruciating agony. No sleep, no escape. No exit, just PhD work (yes, and not easily — like literally fighting through my will and peak of human spirit) and torture. Skin dry, teeth calcifying (at a dental cleaning appointment, the hygienist diagnosed it as calcification and the attributed cause as dry mouth due to benzodiazepines), no memory, no linguistic expression, cognition completely grey and burning. All color gone, all imagery, all imagination, only pain, perpetual pain and fear. Terror. Terror terror terror. I remember one day trying to do $4*7$, and not being able to. They say the only thing to fear is fear itself: GABA downregulation is fear itself. The experience is like being in a warzone. It's like burning alive — without stop — more than a year, torture. The neurochemical experience is literally what you go through if you're in a warzone, and being chased by a predator, while in the middle of having a seizure: hellfire, indescribable pain. I remember staying up nights shaking, just shaking, electricity swarming through me, my face curled, deformed as I tensed and agonized all night unless I got some sleep if I was lucky and then waking up feeling like that, again, for the rest of the day, every day, for months like this. 

[Even at lower comparative doses than what I took, by people who are seen as teachers of manliness,](https://youtu.be/laheAXdZK7w?si=FuPXGh1cLuuvtfHW) this experience of misery and crippling agony is experienced.

I remember trying CBD oil or L-theanine to try to sleep. Latter didn't work — the CBD oil, which I got from that herbal apothecary near the house on May St., when I stopped in because I didn't know that building had become a herbal apothecary, helped a little, and after I talked with the store workers about the different herbs and chemicals they had with probably way more knowledge than they expected, the person at the counter asked to add me as a friend on Facebook, which was serendipitous and miraculous for me, but then she stopped replying as soon as I messaged suggesting they host meditations in the park next door because my wording/thinking was probably [awkward](https://www.reddit.com/r/socialanxiety/comments/dzx7or/not_to_get_into_toxic_territory_but_sometimes_i/), due to literal brain damage from the benzos. The personality consequences of the extreme [anxiety](https://www.reddit.com/r/socialanxiety/comments/dzx7or/not_to_get_into_toxic_territory_but_sometimes_i/), [brain fog](https://www.reddit.com/r/benzorecovery/comments/cdmid6/is_extreme_brain_fog_normal_before_even_beginning/), and [impaired speech](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/316ec47a-248e-4141-9eb7-5888bc1ea93d), plus total hair loss, harmed my social life more than can be stated, and lasting trauma regarding people from the interactions with the psychiatrists and medical staff coercions.

These symptoms [persisted](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/dyaf8n/constant_chest_pain_that_spikes_into_my_neck/) for more than a year, and the trauma persists. <!-- I've read former cocaine and heroin addicts anecdotally report that long-term benzo neurotoxicity involves more horrific suffering than withdrawal from cocaine or heroin. --> 

I saw anecdotes [in this website](https://www.reddit.com/r/BadPill/) from former addicts of heroin or cocaine who were on benzos, who reported that those side effects and withdrawals <!-- of benzo-induced GABA downregulation --> were worse than the side effects and withdrawals that they had suffered from heroin or cocaine (and similar type anecdotal reports comparing the drugs elsewhere, e.g., probably abundant [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/benzorecovery/), though at the surface hard to believe).<!-- I'm sure there isn't an experience on this Earth that is worse, humanly or cosmically possible (a year without sleep, non-stop neurochemical fire, not sure that's even imaginable). -->

## Machinery<!--Wizard--> behind the curtain

- The drug empire was disguised as the University of Rochester.
- The drug dealers were disguised as the University of Rochester's psychiatrists.
- The benzo drug market is a $3 billion industry disguised as the University of Rochester's medicine. 

Suspiciously, there were even contradictions in recent studies from previous decades, on the same drugs: ["the Medical Research Council (MRC) in Britain agreed in 1982 that there should be large-scale studies to examine the long-term impact of benzodiazepines after research by a leading psychiatrist showed brain shrinkage in some patients similar to the effects of long-term alcohol abuse."](https://www.psychologytoday.com/intl/blog/side-effects/201011/pharmaceutical-scandal-in-britain-sheds-disturbing-new-light) The study was buried: ["The only problem with the MRC's response to such warnings about benzos? It appears to have sat for thirty years on the very documents that warned about the risks of brain shrinkage in patients taking them. Moreover, the MRC appears to have marked the documents 'closed until 2014,' despite their obvious importance to public health. [...] 'Members of Parliament and lawyers,' she continues, 'described the recently revealed documents as a scandal, and predicted they could lead the way to a class action costing millions.'"](https://www.psychologytoday.com/intl/blog/side-effects/201011/pharmaceutical-scandal-in-britain-sheds-disturbing-new-light)

What could've caused three psychiatrists, with zero consensus between each other, and zero consent from the patient, to cause so much damage? I suspect the >5 months of inconsistent psychiatrist and doctor plans were due to the self-reinforcing biases clinicians (in the general sense) can create in themselves as they change a patient's personality through chemical interventions. My personality started very charming and cheerful due to the benzos, at which point they still planned to wean me off within the hospital. Then fear and anxiety rose due to increasing downregulation. As those induced neurological changes "doctored" my perception and psyche, my believability lessened (due solely to reduced neurological function, not any fundamental behavioral change aside from mental impairment, and no catatonia, or mania, or delusion), and each changing shift of psychiatrists extended the asserted duration of the coerced prescription of the previous, changing the plans of the previous psychiatrists, culminating with the outpatient doctor only willing to increase, with no taper schedule on the planned horizon. Doctors are aggressively playing Gods, and have no understanding of the severe bias that their own interventions produce in their own or each other's clinical decision-making. Measurement-bias is a known problem in science. Detection can result in a change in the state of the physical system (or organism or body) being detected. In medicine, this problem is less widely understood since the subjects being observed, detected, analyzed, judged, and changed are people.

> To do: remove redundant information below about how my grandma got dementia chapter, and move additional relevant information from here there.

As these months progressed, my [facial structure changed, wrinkled and my face rapidly lost healthy appearance](https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/1dyn2es/comment/lce3ie3/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button), so much so as even my advisor remarked, empathetically, "You look terrible." Measuring damages to an intelligent person's intelligence fully is impossible. I was able to get straight A's in my grad level classes, TA a class, and pass an area exam in the time that I was brain damaged, even worse than I'm describing now. And that took a lot of resourcefulness, will, and spirit, like Matt-Damon-potatoes-on-Mars kind of human spirit, that can't be underestimated. But if *those* grad-level metrics can't measure the damage to my cognitive functioning, how could the tests that psychiatric researchers who believe benzos "can be safely taken for years"<!-- have-->? My grandma, in her early and later dementia, passed every test, like picking between two index cards about a color previously shown or reciting numbers that the doctor had just cited, and unambiguously to both family *and doctors* had dementia, dementia, the worst possible case scenario of this, and one that [studies have also shown benzos contribute to the likelihood of in elderly people](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6325366/) — and for that matter, how have any psychiatric research protocols evaluated whether somebody taking benzos in their 20s doesn't contribute to the likelihood of their dementia in their 80s? My family is intelligent, and we have a lot of will to work really hard. My friend, who was triple-majoring at the University of Rochester, told me she was driving once on acid. I was like, "Really, how?" and she said, "It's mostly muscle memory..." In other words, even under an extraordinarily altered state of consciousness, like the kind induced by acid, she would still plausibly be able to pass a driving test, and the same is true for drugs that alter one's consciousness, body, and neurology harmfully. No existing set of tests can measure how much an intelligent person's life, personality, cognition, and everything by which they live by, can be destroyed by the damages that psychiatric drugs cause which are hard to articulate and express in the midst of subjectively, even when those damages are extremely overt, and are incredibly insidious to the "more objective" tests that psychiatric researchers have, tests that try to come up with a metric for intelligence, the solution to which (used as a label source for a differentiable discriminator) would literally solve all of AI. 

ChatGPT, perhaps itself a wizard behind the curtain — an artificial program — could pass their human cognition or psychiatric tests with flying pixels, probably better than a human in good health.

Until recently, [lobotomies](https://psychcentral.com/blog/the-surprising-history-of-the-lobotomy) and [conversion therapies](https://time.com/6344824/how-common-is-conversion-therapy-united-states/) were standard psychiatric practice. Coercion in psychiatric medicine, especially long-term, especially of benzos will be recognized by medicine as barbaric.

As it turns out, the disorder was with the psychiatrists all along. "Toto, we're not in Xanax anymore," the University of Rochester medical system says to itself, as it peddles more big pharma flying monkeys. When the prison guards are criminals and the prisoners are saints, things are backwards. Likewise, when the doctors are drug dealers and the patients would be regarded in Tibet or other cultures as showing early signs of shamanic intuitions (as both Jeremiah and Sarah did, I later came to learn from direct undeniable experience with them, and as [others who presented similar symptoms to mine](https://youtu.be/CFtsHf1lVI4?si=c7HOzpchsB2NeP1-) did, myself included), there's a disorder *of* the system, and it's not one that's classified in the DSM-5.

While I was living in the House on May St., and still in the early stages of my work, Henry wrote to me, “Ideas are cheap. Execution is hard.” However, I have a pretty good track record of following through on my ideas. 

The benzos forced on me an idea that almost become too much of an "execution."

The risk of mortality was a foreseeable outcome <!--by my psychiatrists-->from benzos, [as published study data shows](https://thischangedmypractice.com/long-term-benzodiazepine-mortality-schizophrenia/), that suicide is a probable risk in long-term benzo usage of patients presenting symptoms similar to mine.

You know, the way I learned about the calcification was because chunks of what I thought were tooth were falling out. Just chunks of tooth-like pieces from my mouth. So I went to the dental hygienist and she said it was de-calcification. This was already when I was starting to recover to some extent, when I was already on the steak-only diet. To reiterate: it started *de*-calcifying at that point. The calcification built up a lot during the 6 months I was on benzos. That was her diagnosis: calcification due to dry mouth from benzos. The steak-diet saved my teeth, I think.

I had to buy waist straps to finally start to recover because I couldn't sit up from the debilitated position I shook with anxiety in on the couch.

The steak diet, which I began after the severest of these symptoms and withdrawing from benzos, in spring, 2020, helped my cognitive/energy/mood recovery.

And after all of this, [literally nothing was cured](https://www.reddit.com/r/kundalini/comments/kvbjhs/does_anyone_feel_physically_moved_by_some/). Which reality — theirs, wherein the conditions that lead to hospitalization are accidents that need to be militantly defeated (wherein meditation, yoga, good social life, intelligence, healthy Paleo diet, and maybe even an antipsychotic wouldn't suffice), or mine, wherein their practices are full of "psychiatric disorder" (and, as will be shown, more than just psychiatric, but environmental, dietary, social, and more) — makes more sense?

The trauma I went through during my psychosis (which the psychiatrists didn't even know about) doesn't compare to the >year of benzo neurochemical torture. 

During this time, my mom found and my family took away the helium tank connected to tubing I was going to kill myself with.

Sometime concurrently, I built the disease prognostication website. It was my idea that I had to argue for, build, and prove to convince them it was a good idea. Through brain damage, I built it, proved the concept to bosses and other researchers through hard work and an actual prototype, and presented it at a conference in DC where I had to take benzos to cognitively function. They took the idea after liking my version, they hired their own team, and they gave me no credit. <!--I believe, at this time though, Henry had aranged them as the source of my funding via the "Udall Center grant," "designed to support innovation and discovery in Parkinson's Disease."-->

## <!--B-?-->Beginnings of recovery

The next semesters, my classes were okay<!-- or coercive. I had to take Program Synthesis with Sri Pai, a professor I really like. It was still hard. B- was from a different systems professor, for which the story is quite bad. A fraction of a point, separated me from a B, even after I came into his office and he was ready to bump it up, he probably wasn't satisfied with the lack of flying colors I had and didn't believe me that my work would involve systems, and at the end of the meeting, decided to leave my grade at a B- for Operating Systems, and because I got a B-, in Operating Systems, like 0.1 of a point difference from B (since it would be rounded up), I had to retake a grad-level systems class, since PhD students are required to get a B or higher. A was Program Synthesis, the class I chose to meet the retake requirement, in which I educated Sree and the class about deep learning (AI) for program synthesis, the state of the art in that field (though at the time wasn't), got an A for his appreciation and my good teaching, and in all honesty, though I like Sree, did did more teaching than learning in this class I had to take by my earlier professor's bad faith. Systems is my least favorite field, but Sree's Parallel and Distributed Systems class, a different class, was the first and only systems class I ever liked-->. 

<!--So in other words I was coerced to take a class that turned out okay because I "got to" teach it with a professor I liked from yet a different systems class, because a different systems professor fell on the fence of deciding I had to do a semester of more grad-level systems work due to that ~0.1 fraction of a point and not believing my efforts to make the case that my own research would involve systems work, after our meeting. I mention this though because it recurs again many semesters later when my research ended up having to involve novel systems research due to new committee member's suggestions, that I did, that went unappreciated even worse than my argument to the B- one that my research later would (see ["Chris Kanan"](#chris-kanan)).-->

Sree introduced me to [Piazza](#kids), which is a great educational tool.

And in Spring, 2020, I worked in the office at the Med Center as my brain was just barely entering the first vestiges of recovery. I was [coming into the Med Center office regularly, working on the disease prognostication data and models on-site, and exercising again.](https://www.facebook.com/share/p/ShD9b4SeSA9Ebzbq/) 

Had I taken a medical leave at the peak of this, at the end of the Spring, 2019 semester, I would've lost my salary, and wouldn't have been able to return for a long time, since the benzo brain damage was just getting started, in which case I most likely would've lost my health insurance, been delayed on all this work, including the area exam, for yet another year at least (including the time to write it), and, given [Henry's tenuous status having announced his intention to accept a directorship offer from the NSF](#red-light-at-clover-st-advisor-leaves), most likely would've been terminated for not having an advisor.

## Red light at Clover St. (advisor leaves)
> [!NOTE]
> ### Buffy
>
> In high school, I loved Lost, and Community, and Better Off Ted, and at some point Reaper, a show no one's heard of<!-- (well, I guess Reaper was middle school)-->. But my favorite-favorite has been Buffy the Vampire Slayer, which at the time was available on Netflix. I was obsessed.<!--, as well as with [Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog](https://youtu.be/Of9kHpCv1ts?si=FPBQagGV-MX0BOK4).-->
>
> Almost nobody heard of Buffy in my high school, 2009 - 2013, Golden Age Peak TV era. I had a debate with my friend, another film buff, where I claimed TV shows were better than movies. He didn't believe me yet. In my high school, all those TV shows were getting missed<!--, at least by many of the people I talked to-->. Buffy had been out since the 90s/early 2000s, and was the most — maybe universally at my high school — unappreciated.
>
> The first person who took my recommendation got through multiple seasons, on my repeated insistence, and still didn't like it.
>
> It wasn't until my senior year I met somebody who liked Buffy the Vampire Slayer. I met him because he commented on a friend's Facebook post about a totally different shared interest, and I messaged him, he wanted to hang out to my surprise, and then he invited me to his birthday party. There, I met other kids who went to his school, including the other Buffy fan I met in high school, one of his friends who walked right up to me with a big smile and was so enthusiastic about my Buffy love. 
>
> Two of the first friends I made in college, by extreme coincidence, loved nerdy shows, especially Joss Whedon shows and Buffy, and were the <!-- girls--> people in my neighboring dorm. One of them later told me she didn't like Buffy that much. Her girlfriend however was such a big Buffy fan that she even made me feel guilty for not knowing some trivia about one of the episodes. The other one was one of the only people I ever watched Buffy together with. They both became my best friends that semester and I half-lived in their dorm. The other dorm near ours also housed <!--a girl--> someone who liked Buffy a lot, by chance. I was roomed near them by the university's random selection. Extreme Buffy fandom wasn't *that* common in college.
>
> Buffy appreciation, quite honestly, was how I measured intelligence then. Wealth and higher education, though, also seemed to increase likelihood of Buffy fandom, but not so as to without further Buffy-factor predict intelligence. It was a big surprise to me to meet those people in the private school, and then more people in college, with an appreciation for the shows I appreciated. It was literally surreal.
>
> I was so nervous with the first group, and regret missing the chance to bond more with them. The second group didn't make sense to me, but I was surrounded, and there was no escape from the universe giving me a good social life.
>
> From college to PhD, I didn't know Henry's favorite show was Buffy.
> 
> I was accepted as his PhD student not knowing that. I found out two semesters into the PhD program, and was kind of shocked. He said he was "obsessed with" Buffy, which he added is "kind of weird." I dropped off my "Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Philosophy: Fear and Trembling in Sunnydale" book, with a kind note, in his mailbox as a gift, re-gifting it from my best friend.
>
> Henry had a rare taste for something that others hadn't heard of as much, that would later contribute to the creation of something everybody has heard of. Joss Whedon created Buffy, and later wrote The Avengers, exploding from esoteric-nerdom to Blockbuster-God-man to cancelled-bad-man. Interestingly, Henry quipped and talked in a way reminiscent to Joss Whedon, and had theater writing experience, though as my advisor, Henry was more like Giles, Buffy's Watcher (advisor). Similarly, the method that I had a rare appreciation for, MHDPA, that had gone on to transformer-roll-out into being ChatGPT, would, much like Marvel movies, destroy civilization.
>
> Back in high school, all the best shows got cancelled, for which Joss Whedon was notorious, because of Firefly. So, so as to distinguish both of us from bad movie execs and producers, I am adding this paragraph just to say that I am not cancelling Henry.

Henry got an offer to direct the AI division at the National Science Foundation in DC, which is an extremely prestigious role. So he accepted, initially advised me while directing there, after some time had to start planning to give up being my advisor, reassured me that his knowledge of deep learning wasn't good enough anyway, and directed me to switch to Chenliang Xu as my next advisor, who gave me an ultimatum about joining.

<!--
Compared the threat of AI to thinking about “traffic regulation on Mars”

“Traffic regulation on mars” quote can frame how that’s what Henry’s NSF directorship job in DC was, while he neglected to see through his final student to the completion of his degree. 
-->

Henry thought Chenliang would be better due to his having more experience in deep learning, but may have overestimated how much any professor at our CS department could afford me in terms of anything related to research and methods. Chenliang, for example, who was working on state of the art Computer Vision, had about as much familiarity with MHDPA in 2020 as Dan Gildea had in 2018, perhaps a little more. Before I was his student, in 2020, I presented using MHDPA on image features as an encoder architecture for Semantic Segmentation to him, on his whiteboard, with an explanatory diagram in my journal for what MHDPA was that I showed him, and a diagram on the whiteboard for my proposed Semantic Segmentation method. In 2020, one of Chenliang's students was using a transformer on a sequence-to-sequence problem (not as an encoder architecture), but Chenliang, a Computer Vision professor, didn't know much what MHDPA and transformers were until Vision Transformers gained popularity in 2021.

<!--
Chenliang was younger than Henry, a good amount closer to my age than Henry's, and didn't have tenure yet, though he acquired it [a couple years after accepting me into his lab. ]() -->

<!--

-->

<!-- He got tenure in that time, and had his son in that time. -->

Chenliang's real contribution was having GPUs, something I missed the deadline for while under Henry, as I had been given access to the NSF's for my honorable mention in the GRFP I applied to, but only if I made an account within a specified time window, right in the middle of my benzo withdrawal, that I missed.

I managed to publish 2 papers under Chenliang. <!--The number of papers published by Henry's--> Henry's average student paper count was 1 - 3 across the PhD student's full 5 - 7 years. 
<!--
Chenliang had no other problems or qualms with me, the second professor to abandon his advising responsibility, this time with far less justification, seeing as Henry believed it would be best for me to have an advisor with deep learning experience, and had a stated intention, though unverified, to fund me himself if all else failed.
-->

Until Henry's retirement in 2022, which he didn't warn me about and came to me as a surprise from Chenliang, he stayed on as my PhD committee member.

To this day, Henry hasn’t acknowledged that what I was arguing to him about, had implemented, and had innovated on in 2018 — MHDPA, the method that underpins transformers such as those used in AI models like ChatGPT — was worth crediting to me in any way. In other words, he hasn’t said “hey, you were right!” or anything to that effect, despite the huge foresight and work delivered to him by his own student before even 5 groups in the world had used the method, let alone every iPhone and AI research lab and AI foundation model, as has become the case now.

- I started losing my hair in my 1st year
- I started taking benzos in my 2nd year
- I started working in Chenliang Xu's lab nearing the end of my 3rd year

<!--Chenliang was an associate professor, younger than Henry.--><!--, and didn't have tenure yet, but would obtain tenure and a firstborn in the coming years.-->

At the time of asking to join Chenliang's lab, the end of my 3rd year (near the end of Spring semester, 2020, before the university began Covid lockdowns), I had no publications.

Chenliang gave me an ultimatum: Submit a top-venue *Computer Vision* paper by end of summer, without pay, or no acceptance. Had I failed to do that, I wouldn't have an advisor or pay, and most likely, would've been terminated.

I presented Semantic Segmentation with MHDPA applied to image features. That, applied to a Computer Vision domain specifically, would've been the first Vision Transformer, but there wasn't enough time to build and benchmark that with the pressure and deadline from Chenliang.

I had to work at the Med Center concurrently for funding, since Chenliang wasn't paying me, and had to spend at least a month giving my nights and weekends to achieving his ultimatum by the summer, 2020 NeurIPS deadline.

He also said I'd have to come in every day to do that work in his lab, which I ended up not having to do due to the lockdowns.

He accepted me into his lab when I successfully delivered that [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.08601), my first published paper, "Psyche-CAM" (*name modified here for reason that will become apparent*), ended up getting positive reviews, rejected, and then later accepted at ICCV, a top-venue conference (in AI, conferences are bigger than journals, and that was quite a feat for a few months, in a brand new research area, switching fields from "medical prognostication" to "state of the art Computer Vision").

It's ironic also that when he announced his desertion (due to not having published enough papers in that time frame), on ****07/24/2023****, 3 years later, I was in the middle of a paper review with positive reviews, [that got accepted](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41524-023-01164-8), another published paper.

During those 3 years, for the most part, Chenliang didn't directly fund me. At first I worked at the Medical Center. Then, he put me on a Mechanical Engineering lab, where I didn't work *instead of* his ordinary group requirements, but entirely on top of. In fact, none of the 3 committee members who the deciding Judge, and CS department Chair Michael Scott, attributed to my termination in my 6th year, addressed or acknowledged that I was working for and receiving funding for my work from the Mechanical Engineering department at the time, not from CS (meaning, the people who'll later terminate me, weren't the people giving me my paid work, technically at nearly any point; even prior to Chenliang was Med Center and a NSF NRT stipend that I applied for).

<!--Also during those 3 years, Chenliang [got tenure](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b064fc1d-d941-4d9c-8b51-ec3390f827c8), had his first child, and boasted his Computer Vision lab's high publication ranking on CSRankings during that 3-year period.-->

Meanwhile, under Niaz, in the Mechanical Engineering department, specifically Materials Science, I produced exactly the paper rate that she wanted, and through really hard work to make sure the ideas, experiments, grant-writing, data, and programming were all really high quality ([here is the GitHub repo I built for us](https://github.com/AGI-init/XRDs)).

Last-minute, and with almost no notice, and without Niaz's approval, Chenliang wanted to allocate that Mechanical Engineering-work funding to someone else, due to me not providing enough publications in his Computer Vision group. Yes that funding that I helped earn — literally — through the programming and grant ideas and grant writing and grant diagrams, definitively leading and exceptionally implementing the AI side of the work on which all of the models were built and experiments were run and plotted, as well as running and plotting the experiments, and with support and appreciation from the rest of the group as I taught them deep learning in each of our meetings every week, which included Chenliang — that funding to someone else. He'd given me no prior warning or indication of dissatisfaction. Quite the opposite actually.

As Niaz said, "I don't know what he was thinking."

## Comedic Aside: Sexier moments during Chenliang advising:

Got to message someone named Psyche a week after my Psyche-CAM paper who reached out to me on Facebook who turned out to be a cam-girl (["Psyche-CAM"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.08601))… 
- She started interacting with me one week after I archived my ["Psyche-CAM"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.08601) paper summer 2020, my first-ever published paper. She told me about a similar trauma she went through on the same Christmas, 2018 night, together with her *bald Jewish* husband (who she was married to at the time). After intensely flirting with me and telling me she loved me, including at one point offering to pay for my plane tickets to fly to her (which I couldn't do because of an eczema outbreak that coincided during the late summer), she lost interest in me and increasingly made clear that she was seeing other guys.

> [!WARNING]
> ### Psyche hospitalization
>  
> I felt something drained out of my soul. I was so devastated. After a period of continued intense discipline, intensified yoga exercise and calisthenics, coping in denial with [music that reminded me of her](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/2XhzJmfX4I59YfEQQfA3Xq?si=4a327c3a8fb04cfb), even fasting, and gradually starting to observe those Kundalini physical sensations again (quite notably, that I talked about it to my mom as I was going through this), I got hospitalized again in early October. That was the hospitalization that I resisted with combative attempts by fighting the police while I was in the grass where I was having a kind of spiritually-guided breakdown. The amount of mourning I was feeling can't be described, and it wouldn't stop for long after this. And it was through that hospitalization I got her back — temporarily. In the beginning journey of that hospitalization, I observed myself seeming convinced by the possibility that I was going through different dimensions, but I believed that they were all one dimension, one consistent reality, that I held faith to, the same rational one that I always knew, literally. But the meaning of that, interpreting years later like a kind of dream interpretation, could be varied. One is that I was losing my world because I was losing Psyche. My psychology was somehow intrinsically linked to that relationship, through our conversations and linguistics. Another, more Hallmark-card one (that is perhaps a bad-taste Christmas pun), is that I had gone "crazy for her," but literally. And that's true also. Another is about the nature of flirting and communication. The many dimensions and ambiguities of flirting, linguistics, phonetics and other symbolism. Yet another is that Psyche sent me a lot of messages, and now the universe was about to do the same.
>
> One of the dimensions was a lizard-person dimension, where some nurses were subjugated to others. Nurses to clinicians, rather, whose stature next to their clinical authorities was small and diminished, like they were being oppressed by a lizard race of people, in the future. Perhaps the meaning of that can be interpreted as the hierarchy relationships that our employment systems create, that on some deep subconscious level, mythologically, they are like a lizard-people relationship of rulers who've conquered the Earth, and humans with no agency under their tyranny.
>
> Another was a demon dimension. I did a yogically-guided "exorcism," as demons from the hospital's energies were popping on me. The nurse asked what I was doing when she caught me, moving and making the noises I was making (speaking in tongues, now that I think about it, maybe, but the tongues had semantics), and I said "exercising." She was satisfied with that answer. I think the message there was that exercise is good. Glad we could decipher that mystery — but actually, the yogic state of impersonating the energetic and linguistic forces that were inhabiting me, seemed to rid me of them and return me back to a flow state that was mine. Like doubling down on their corruptions to the point that they themselves become absurd and vanish. It worked.
>
> Another was a robot dimension. And the robot dimension I think was a message about the use of robots in hospitals, the terrible dissociation from humanity that comes from a robotic nurturer pretending to be human, cold and far from humane, or technology being either wrongly objectified or wrongly humanized. <!--vis a vis a cyborg.-->
>
> One was Psyche-tyranny one, where I was under her unforgiving judgement, debating her about something, some nature of a two-sided Kundalini, where somehow I was trying to defend that both are one (or more specifically, that the two can communicate, like Wernicke and Broca's areas...).
>
> That's also literally where I started getting my [evolutionary learning ideas](https://github.com/slerman12/BuildingBlocks/blob/master/Population.py), with attention, which apparently to my surprise [had some positive results](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1sw2Iu6foH3dmn-7a2JfijCljqheH_A3fEW5OuK-68Yg/edit?usp=sharing), though I don't even remember doing that. [I just remember having made this video](https://youtu.be/TEKgesBVTJ0?si=OtXQYMZgVd3Qu36M) (all within a pretty short time period after the hospitalization, and at this point Chenliang's group was becoming really impressed with me, and I was starting to build a good reputation, though that would only develop, occassionally me getting side-tracked with some other really good [ideas](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1QbWNfnWAgm0rHTy4EFnDrjpaMP7Ako6isNxOUSR17_A/edit?usp=sharing) and/or implementations ([BioNet](https://github.com/slerman12/UnifiedMLold2/tree/master/Blocks/Architectures/LermanBlocks/BioNet), [ViRP](https://github.com/slerman12/UnifiedMLold2/blob/master/Blocks/Architectures/LermanBlocks/ViRP.py), or [Thousand Brains](https://github.com/slerman12/UnifiedMLold2/blob/master/Blocks/Architectures/LermanBlocks/ThousandBrains.py)), mysteriously always side-tracked despite my interest and usually some positive result, until when I was building [UnifiedML](https://github.com/AGI-init/UnifiedML-legacy) (to be described [below](#chris-kanan)) — consistently over more than 2 years, finally not side-tracked, er, until I was terminated — they were pretty much in awe of me and I felt reasonably appreciated for the first time for my work). But distracting deep learning revelations aside, back to craziness: Traveling dimensions, debating hypothetical Psyche about some metaphysics philosophy... resume...
>
> Afterwards, I went through more interesting rituals with the nurses that I'll describe below under [Rituals, Religion, & Hell](#rituals-religion--hell).
>
> Lastly, after I was finally landed in the psychiatric unit, I met an older woman who Bar Mitzvah'd me. I should *maybe* put that in quotes.
>
> That inpatient got her dad to bring in a prayer sheet that he suggested I memorize for later recitation out loud. Over the next week or more, that inpatient — who curiously looked and sounded like a late 40s or early 50s Sarah — insisted I read it, and I had the instinct to, as she ritually sanctified it via sharing the same trance kind of state I was in in which we both sensed that I had to do that, as we both paced around the window end of the hallway, not far from everybody else, as I recited from memory and she like did her own intuitive ritualistic movements.
>
> I recall the prayer included the word "vitzivanu," but it was longer and ended differently than [this one](https://doingjewish.blog/2022/02/18/the-shabbat-candle-lighting-blessing-and-calling-on-the-ancestors-for-connection-and-wisdom/#:~:text=Baruch%20ata%20Adonai%2C%20Eloheinu%20Melech,commandment%20of%20lighting%20Shabbat%20candles.). Her dad (who did this of his and that inpatient's own accord) was actually Christian but he knew I was Jewish and the prayer he brought was Hebrew. Later, he came to visit that woman again, where he wanted me to recite it in front of him, and I did, from memory, as they'd wanted.
>
> - I was discharged from the hospital after less than two weeks, on October 17.
>
> In that hospitalization, I learned a tongue trick that I'm still impressed with myself by that allowed me to circumvent any medications, even though the nurses made you open your mouth and stick your tongue out both above and below. I got damn fast at making the switch of the pill from under my tongue to roof of my mouth. I'm gonna add an exclamation point, because that was worthy of some awe: !. Oh no, I sense a judgemental reader looming. Hello judgemental reader. Try 12 - 2.5 mg of Ativan every day for >6 months and then come back to me with your judgements. But to emphasize, they literally made you show your mouth above your tongue and below, and somehow I flipped the medications fast enough to keep both "ahhhh"s from betraying my dexterous deceit / sleight of hand. 
>
> It was also one of the last hospitalizations for me, ever. And it was a good one because — controversially or not, this did make a difference: I got to escape taking too many synthetic medicines via the tongue trick, and the nurses were all my age and beautiful, which is an understated human medical need, and I was severely lacking that kind of warmth through almost all of my PhD.
>
> That other inpatient who looked like an older Sarah, who narrativized it via her dad, made the experience a sacred non-delusion, and neither of us made the connection that that Hebrew prayer might've been a Bar Mitzvah (perhaps that's stupid of me) until I kind of connected the dots of this context years later.
>
> Those kinds of ritualistic non-gaslighting shared interpretations do far more to heal a person from the underlying causes of their mental breakdown than medications, as proved to be the case for me. I actually happened to call Psyche from that hospitalization, even manically told her "I'm Jesus," as my linguistics seemed to literally guide themselves on their own, blissfully, and she somehow took me back temporarily after that (into her flirting DMs), until our shared birthday week, at which time, since I guess I was a certified man by all "good enough" synthetic metaphorical Bar Mitzvah standards, I guess I was ready for the ultimate coming of age ritual: being blocked by a beautiful woman I really like (she was the first, or at most second, person to have ever blocked me). 
> - Yes, our birthdays coincided. Well, week-wise. She was a couple years younger than me. And she'd told me, a bald hairless traumatized 5'5" socially anxious guy with much less experience she loved me, within months of when we started interacting, if that, yes in that kind of way, yes meaning it, well, when she said it.
> - I bring this up because our interaction started exactly a week after I archived my Psyche-CAM paper, and she also suffered her trauma on Christmas, 2018, together with a bald Jewish guy, in addition to her being named Psyche and a cam-girl, and our birthdays coinciding, [and other "coincidences" as well](https://github.com/animal-tree/SuspiciousnessofSynchronicitiesAndParanoia/blob/main/Does-anyone-else-think-this-is-proof-of-God%3F.md).
> - See [Intimacy healing](#intimacy-healing) for what the meaning of this might be.
> - I hadn't realized any of these synchronicities until almost a year after this hospitalization.
> - Psyche's actual name and spelling, and my paper's phonetically-same name, are anonymized best I can, which is too bad since the actual name, which has an even different spelling than the not-anonymized one in my paper, is a good pun about the weaver/tailor of the "fabric" of spacetime, also different spelling (and, even with first name and all this info, and connection to me, she's still anonymized).
>
> Regarding the beautiful nurses, I even got reprimanded for trying to flirt with one of them by writing my phone number on an attendance sheet, inspired somewhat by Psyche's personality, and got patronizingly lectured by a man about respecting the women nurses in the hospital, despite him and the hospital staff being the ones in the position of authority, me being held captive and drugged there against my will (by them), cameras and police everywhere, and me neither wanting to be there nor feeling comfortable. But, in my defense, in case I somehow come out like the predator in this calculus, the flirting was from a manic delusion type thing, yogic-type sense that I had to. In none of these hospitalizations was I acting on any primitive (read: "for pleasure") impulses, nor through any of this. The whole time I was under the sense or deluded belief that Psyche's spirit was the one governing this, but that turned out [maybe](https://github.com/animal-tree/SuspiciousnessofSynchronicitiesAndParanoia/tree/main) unvalidated, and I came out lucid without that mania or deluded belief, having unknowingly undergone a meaningful ritual with a fellow inpatient, and not consumed any pills except maybe small traces. That was also the hospitalization where I met [Harry](#kids), the 16 year old with drug problems who they drugged with benzos for years.
>
> The [next one was in a geriatric unit (a facility for the elderly)](#geriatric-unit-hospitalization), so consider me reprimanded.

<!--
On the note of synchronicities:

- Waxed wise with a close friend ([Jeremiah](#hospitalization)) who I met on a trip to Israel many years back — someone who rather serendipitously was seated next to me on that plane — about reinforcement learning on Facebook, reconnected, and at his birthday party ran into someone who my religious friend (different guy incidentally, Josiah) introduced me to years ago, who I then kept running into the next weeks at the beach literally by just remarkable luck, and each usually-accidental date we had was like a reinforcement learning episode, of me trying to listen to my subconscious and instinct, and getting rewarded or punished and ultimately the world's lowest ever score aside from one much needed hug! We were both RL agents in that one (no not ["reinforcement learning agents"](https://github.com/slerman12/UnifiedMLold2/tree/master/Agents), "real life agents")! The fun never ends. 
- Somebody I was texting, who I knew from undergrad, was planning to go to Acadia National Park with me, and that inspired me to call my [rQdia paper](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&as_sdt=0%2C33&q=rqdia&btnG=) "rQdia" (pronounced Arcadia), but that one was on purpose, and it was rejected, and we ended up not going (it's still in the not-really-planned-but-hypothetical books)!

<!--
- The next summer I got another miraculous house situation where this really attractive person my age gave me a house rental without a lease with her lesbian roommate (roommates plural ‘cause girlfriend) and no background checks, where I came up with my [BittleBot idea with the methodology of using YouTube](https://github.com/AGI-init/Tributaries/blob/73e95d5006438f678507d0067025e484e66c6e73/Examples/Sweeps/Bittle.py#L11), and she was like a famous YouTuber, and not even the first talented YouTuber I got to meet (the other one by chance while I was editing [a YouTube video](https://youtu.be/VKoSfmECpx0?si=6PNBfaqbE-iY_GV8) in the park)! Then we never talked again (except the second person who I ran into a few years later, by a [physics-subverting](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41524-023-01164-8) precognitive sense that I can't even describe here, who I talked to around the theme of "fire" just before I wrote [this essay about fire](Philosophy/Fire.md) and Chenliang called me in to notify/"fire" me I didn't get him enough papers — not sure what that would've entailed considering the statistically significant correlations of all of these probably deserving [their own interrogation of p-value](https://github.com/animal-tree/SuspiciousnessofSynchronicitiesAndParanoia/blob/main/quackery.md)).

Well, I suppose there was the thanksgiving with Sarah (see [in next chapter](#intimacy-healing)), which I also appreciated and appreciate and give thanks to.

## My grandma's childhood

> ### $\Huge &#8220;$
> Moscow was bombed every day, sometimes multiple times a day. 500 airplanes bombed the city in one day. Not only bombs, but also a lot of lighters were thrown from the airplanes. The alarm of the air raid required everyone to step down to the underground [bomb shelters], and I went there too. But if the air raid came at the time of our work shift, we, all working at the armory [defense factory], children<!-- [children working at the defense factory]-->, climbed on the roof. Our responsibility was to take the hot lighters and throw them off the roof, to prevent a fire.
> ### $\Huge &#8221;$
> &ensp;&ensp; - Translated to English by my mom from an interview with my grandma that my mom did for MCC, in October, 2000. Brackets denote my edits.

My grandma was 13 and my great Aunt Tsilia was 18. Their dad was fighting in the war front. Their mother had died when my grandma was 5 and her sister was 10, from typhus. Their step mother was sick with tuberculosis; and their little younger step-brother Yura, 10 years younger than my grandma, was too young to help with throwing the fire bombs.

<!--
My grandma was about 24 when she and my grandpa (different Yura) arrived to Samarkand.  She was a German language teacher, before my uncle was born. She didn't know German, but she knew Yiddish, so she accepted the job, since Yiddish is close to German. Later, she was a teacher of Russian language and Russian literature, separate fields. Later, she was an academic principal of a school and continued teaching.

My grandma was about 24 when she and my grandpa (different Yura) had to immigrate to Samarkand.  She was a German language teacher, before my uncle was born. She didn't know German, but she knew Yiddish, so she accepted the job, since Yiddish is close to German. Later, she was a teacher of two separate fields, Russian language, and literature, and later, an academic principal of a school and continued teaching.

At old age, she had long grey hair, down to even her waist or hips. She curled it up behind her head, in a very elegant/pretty bun, with hair pins.

<!--My grandma had long grey hair, down to almost her waist or hips. She curled it up behind her head with hair pins, like in a bun but prettier.-->

## Nails

In addition to losing all of my hair — head, eyebrows, and eyelashes — due to the Dupilumab cessation, my eczema temporarily spiked and I lost my fingernails in functionality in later 2018, also unambiguously due to the Dupilumab cessation. They regrew, healthily functional enough, after being purple, and bendy like putty, for a really long time, maybe into 2019. 

`Additional side effects included temporarily worsened eczema, and fingernails turning purple and bending like putty.`

My grandma actually told me I had her nails. I even remember where. But I also have her eyes, and my mom's eyes, brown eyes. But, randomly, my grandma mentioned it, about my nails, when we were sitting in the backseat of the car. My mom and grandpa were in the front seats. My mom was probably driving us to the Jewish Community Center, to swim in the community pool there. My grandma saw my fingers and just mentioned that I had her nails, unusual.

Without hair, without eyebrows and eyelashes, with even my grandma's fingernails purple and bending out of my nails, and isolation and heavy workloads, just what I needed was a >6 months course of benzos to get all the symptoms of early-onset dementia.

## The probable cause of my grandma's dementia 

[Benzos contribute to the likelihood of dementia in elderly people](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6325366/).

My grandma was prescribed a cocktail of neuroactive drugs before she had dementia. Seroquel, Lyrica, Xanax, and the brochure goes on. She didn't have any of the conditions those medications are primarily supposed to treat (Seroquel is an antipsychotic, Lyrica is an antiepileptic, Xanax is a benzo), and every time she developed a new symptom from one, they prescribed yet another. She developed dementia when I was still in high school. She lived with dementia from then to my Junior year of college, the same year my grandpa died, 2016.

<!--
That semester I was dating somebody who told me something about my nails. My grandma actually told me I had her nails. I even remember where. But I also have her eyes, and my mom's eyes, brown eyes. But, randomly, my grandma mentioned it, about my nails, when we were sitting in the backseat of the car. My mom and grandpa were in the front seats. My mom was probably driving us to the Jewish Community Center, to swim in the pool there. My grandma saw my fingers and just mentioned that I had her nails, unusual, but something I'm proud of.

In 2016, the semester she died, someone I was dating made an even more unusual remark about my nails.

## How my grandpa died

When I was a kid, I listed off my favorite family members once, in my order of favorite, in front of all of them who were in our apartment living room, either standing or eating at the table. Maybe I was 5 or so. I remember they all looked big and I was standing. Grandpa was sitting in his bigger chair at the table and I started, "Babula" ("Grandma"), "Máma," "Marina," ... and then after all the others who I listed, I listed my grandpa. I still remember that. He wasn't offended, and I love and loved my grandpa a lot. In maybe 16 years, I would be standing by his bedside in the hospital, after a heart surgery he had, when he'd tell me: "Ti moy lyubimey v'nuk" ("You are my favorite grandson."). He has 4 grandkids: Irina, Lena, Marina, and me. I'm his only grandson... 

I remember sitting by my grandpa's bedside, alternating days and nights. My mom or I were needed there at all times. He was almost 88, and the languages he spoke were Russian, Ukrainian, and Yiddish, and he was legally blind. He and I couldn't watch the same TV when he lived with us, because he neither spoke English nor could see, but sometimes when I visited my grandma's and his apartment unit immediately across from ours (after they'd moved, since originally we lived together), we watched Russian Television Network together, and they actually got some Cable channels from the government program, as well. In my apartment, we only had ABC, FOX, NBC, CBS, and PBS. Then we also got an additional channel, the CW. With high school and college, I had, uh, resourcefulness, and Netflix. During those days and nights at his bedside in the hospital, in the hospital recliner chair next to him, I watched a lot of Doctor Who on Netflix on my laptop, a show about an alien with two hearts called The Doctor that resurrects after each death, the previous generation surviving in the next, and the next, and the next. It's the [longest running science fiction show in the world](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_Who#:~:text=The%20series%20has%20been%20listed,ratings%2C%20DVD%20and%20book%20sales.), a show that originally started with an old grandpa.

My grandpa survived two heart attacks previously, one in Uzbekistan and one in America. 

Here is how he ended up in the hospital: Sometime in the month of November, in 2015, he was having trouble breathing, my mom took him to his primary care doctor, she diagnosed him with congestive heart failure, she prescribed pills, then about a month and a week of taking pills later, he was still having trouble breathing, my mom took him to the hospital, they took a blood analysis, and apparently he'd had a third heart attack, that occurred about a week before. So my grandpa's heart doctor came into the hospital, recommended a stent be put in my grandpa's heart's main artery, via a surgery, and that the surgery would use an angiogram. The angiogram would require a dye that is bad for the kidneys. The primary care physician wanted to discharge my grandpa and send him for rehabilitation already, without the surgery; the heart doctor told my mom "without the surgery, his heart would only get worse" and that "he'd only have heart attacks and eventually die," so my mom chose to listen to the heart doctor, they did the angiogram, they tried to do the surgery, but the main artery was completely blocked, the surgeon wasn't able to do the surgery so put stents into the little arteries that were narrow but weren't the cause of the congestive heart failure, and right after the impromptu-alternative-surgery, which required an angiogram, which used the dye that was bad for the kidneys, my grandpa's kidneys got so bad he couldn't walk at all anymore; he couldn't stand up on his feet.

I was visiting him on alternating nights before and after the surgery. Then, after the New Year 2016, the hospital didn't know what do with him, discharged him, and sent him to the Jewish home for rehabilitation, for physical therapy to help with his worsened kidneys. They also scheduled a follow-up appointment with his heart doctor in that heart doctor's private office, separate from both the hospital and Jewish home, in a different location from either, for January 21, 2016.

My grandpa was a self-reliant man, but the transit two weeks later on January 21, 2016 from the Jewish home to that heart doctor's office was extreme. My mom was there, and it was a big ordeal just to help him stand amid the kidney problems that were causing him difficulty moving. How big a toll that transfer of locations took: they resorted to using an elevating machine that lifted him, an almost 88 year old man, up from his bed. 

"Why was he discharged from the hospital?" the heart doctor had asked at that appointment in his office. "In this condition, he should be in the hospital."

My grandpa's heart failed that night, after the grueling trial to make the heart doctor appointment, in all likelihood because of that grueling trial. His official death was the night of that heart doctor appointment, January 22, 2016.

My grandpa was not one to miss a grueling transit. On July 3, 1941, my grandpa, his mom Maná, and his younger sister Rosá evacuated Ukraine. They went place to place by train, lived in different places, worked at farms. Once, they took the train from Rostov, and the train stopped. My grandpa was young, maybe 14. He thought, "I'll go to the market nearby and buy something." He bought a little bit of bread and kielbasa. When he came back, he discovered his train already left. So he asked people. They said, "There's a place where those trains stop. You can go there and take another train; they go the same direction, so maybe you can catch up with your previous train," and he saw, one train had already started moving, one train there on that platform, already in motion, and he decided he could jump, so he jumped. He was holding on, but he was gonna fall, and he thought he was gonna fall under the train. But there was someone who picked him up, quickly pulled him on (elevated him onto this big mechanical machine), someone on that train, someone who was there who quickly pulled him up. He ended up making it to their previous train's destination before his mom and sister, waiting for them, as theirs which had more stops in their transit's journey, arrived after him.

This time, my grandpa arrived a little before my grandma, despite being a little younger, in the same year, just a few months before.

In Uzbekistan, it was custom for doctors to visit patients. Physicians always came to patient homes, or wherever the patient was, standardly, in Uzbek healthcare. But America and Uzbekistan had something in common, regarding their healthcare systems: cardiologists (heart doctors) specifically, didn't visit patient homes. In our neighboring apartment units, my grandpa was having trouble breathing, but could still walk, and had survived three heart attacks previous to his death. Perhaps the heart doctor was right, and he'd keep having heart attacks and eventually die, but eventually was the night of their appointment, after a heroic ordeal to get to that office that my grandpa, with heavy strain, survived, and made it back in time to the Jewish home for his final destination, earlier than had he never gotten off the first train for some bread and kielbasa.

## When my grandma died

My grandma, Asya Lerman (Hebrew/American: "Esya") always cooked, healthy and really well, but she had type-2 diabetes at old age.
I remember, for herself, she had to use artificial sweeteners because she couldn't eat pure sugar.
She also made these delicious Russian cookies for us called "Korshike," that I loved, that she also put into these different mold shapes, hearts and stars and fish and circles. I liked to eat the raw dough sometimes, but she didn't let me eat it in large quantities because of eggs and the risk of salmonella.

I had healthier food than the average American as a kid — plov, cabbage stews, potato stews, salads, katleti, tefteli, borscht, pelmeni — despite my family's poverty, but I still had eczema, allergies, and asthma through my whole childhood.

My grandma taught my mom dancing when they were younger, in Uzbekistan. Seeing my grandpa bedridden in the hospital, even before the surgery, it was obvious to me that he was losing strength, just from the sedentary confinement to bed, that the doctors put him in, in a corner of a concrete-surrounded hospital, with no natural light, nature, or fresh air. He would've benefited from some motion, out of bed and walking, outdoors, with nature, with fresh air. At least once a day, each day, without any grueling transits to reach such an environment.

I really think had the hospital recommended my grandpa an organic steak/salmon-only diet, and nothing more, they possibly could've saved his main artery from being blocked, without a surgery. Then no stents would be put into his healthier narrow arteries, no damaged kidneys, no grueling transit to heart doctor. Just physical therapy and rehabilitation. And maybe many more years, living beyond my grandma.

She shortly outlived my grandpa, and died the same year as him **three days before** his April 16 birthday, on April 13, 2016.

I suppose she'd've had to forestall her death as well, then, seeing she died just a few months after he died, in the same year, as if on purpose, joining him exactly 3 days before his April 16 birthday, on April 13, 2016, where 13 both symbolizes a death kind of day and has the number 3, as in 3 days before, and 2016 has the number 16, the upcoming day of my grandpa's birthday.

She couldn't have died on a more perfect day, except if my grandpa lived a many, many years longer.

My grandpa also gets two claims to rhythmic numerical timing: (1) He entered the hospital on December 22, 2015, spent two weeks in the hospital, two weeks in the Jewish home, and then died exactly a month after, on January 22, 2016, (2) He, Yury Lerman, was born "Izya"; but during the war, as documents were lost and "Izya" was a Jewish name amid an extremely anti-semitic Ukraine, he called himself "Yura," or the full name, "Yury," and that became his new name with the new documents when he was about 16, the same age (16 again) as my name was officially changed to "Sam" actually, by amazing ancestral-but-unintended rhyme.

Now for some stretchier synchronicities:

As for my grandma, the number 13 also includes a number that "is less than 3," e.g. a heart <3, which a modern readership might be able to visually appreciate universally across languages, having been a teacher of varied languages, including Ukrainian, Russian, Yiddish, and German (and she also learned English after we immigrated), in her life.

Besides 16, another synchronistic number is 7. My grandma was born March 25, 1927. My mom was born July 17, 1957 (07/17/57). And Irina, who takes the most from my grandma besides me, was born November 17, one day and 6 years apart from my birthday. And my grandpa was 87 when he died.

And 2016 has the number 16, that, besides being the upcoming day of my grandpa's birthday, was the beginning of a larger-scope revolution in politics, and reformed perceptions of the healthcare system, with the 2016 ascent of another, similar Jewish old-grandpa type character and role model to me, Bernie Sanders, who has some similarities to my grandpa. 

My grandma's numerical timing of when she died is a proof symbol in my opinion on the perception and characterized message of my grandpa's death involving the heart doctor seeming synchronistic: that the healthcare system needs reform. And the ascent of Bernie, whose name slantly rhymes with "Yury," synchronized in tune, means a lot to me about the need for reforming healthcare systems, not just in governance, but inside the systems themselves, from elderly care, to prescription habits, to the dietary and environment principles. 

Psyche was 22 (the day my grandpa died), she blocked my heart (as my grandpa’s was) while she was 22. I was 22 when I'd grown out all my hair for the first time. I was 22 when I lost all my hair. I was 22 when I lost all my hair, due to an eczema drug, eczema being the reason I never got to meet her. My hair started growing back during Psyche while she was 22. She blocked my phone around our coinciding birthdays when she turned 23. 23 was my age during my Christmas, 2018 trauma, the one she also had, but with a different bald Jewish guy, the same day/night. <!--When 22 ended, our relationship wasn't yet phone-dead, but was probably dead before then.--> The symbolism would make more sense if, like my grandma, I'd turned 22 and she joined me near my birthday rather than blocking me near then. The symbolism probably connects more to my eczema and hair loss and regrowth, and that trauma, than grandpa and grandma.  

I had severe eczema, and my grandma when I was a kid helped by giving the best massages, and my mom and grandpa too. That may have symbolically pointed to one more aspect of the medical system that might need a revolutionary radical innovation, one that will be discussed, succinctly, later… (see ["Intimacy healing"](#intimacy-healing)).

## Ascent of a Jewish old grandpa

I’d heard about Bernie Sanders from reading about him on Facebook, and I met some supporters who’d even heard of him before his 2015 - 2016 presidential run. I was getting his campaign emails, it was still early in his campaign before the 2016 Democratic primaries, and I told my mom about him, that I wanted to donate from the link in a campaign email from him. She was worried, thinking it might be spam.

That wasn’t implausible, that a politician who her son is describing as actually caring about policies, with principles, who calls himself a "socialist" and is Jewish, and is making serious headway as a contender for the office of president in America, is some kind of trick.

It didn’t take long before she could see he was a serious and sincere "politician," and the word "politician" has to go in quotes, because Bernie’s "politics" are about actual governing.

My mom donated to him, too.

"Bernie Sanders" is a household name today, so much so that some people might roll their eyes, call me a "Bernie bro." But unlike the "Bernie bros" across the Democratic party leadership who have taken on his positions and rhetoric, without giving credit to the fact that they actively stood opposed to those very positions and rhetoric when Bernie was still bringing those views into the mainstream all his life, I’m a [Bernie "supporter,"](https://github.com/slerman12/Governance/blob/main/Does-Nature-Endorse%3F.md) not bro.

Those ideas, like Medicare For All, a $15 minimum wage, ending the corruption of Wall St., acknowledging the huge gap between "the top 1% and the 99%," have become popular talking points thanks to his campaigns (though the non-Bernie talking heads often leave out public funding of elections and overturning Citizens United), which made a bigger difference in American political knowledge and culture than any of the Democrats who campaigned against him, including the one who became president.

My grandpa’s literally-bleeding heart is beating in me, in my body, arterial main artery not blocked. My grandma’s multilingual fluency lives in me as well, as a skill to hear and understand views I disagree with, and communicate, in the varied languages that each tent has, my own views.

I don’t want to echo what has already been taught, and taught effectively, in both 2015/2016 and 2019/2020. This book requires an open mind because it points out issues and reforms that aren’t redundant to the ones Bernie has pointed out, in contexts that may seem familiar to one side or another ("Oh he's anti-medicine!", "Oh he's anti-science!", "Oh he's part of the 'woke mob'!"), but aren't.

How to transition into this? Well, let’s start with my experience in the elderly-care unit.

## Geriatric unit hospitalization

Speaking of the elderly...

> [!WARNING]
> 
> In December, 2020, I had another hospitalization, my last hospitalization, the geriatric unit (elderly facility) one.
>
> I was leading another one of Chenliang's students on a long-term memory paper called [Eclectic-Mem](https://github.com/slerman12/Eclectic-Mem) for Chenliang, that I still had an extremely intense amount of work to do on in order to make the ICML deadline. My family members visited. I was again following some kind of yogic-trance, but this time, much less spiritually guided. I knew that the yogic state I'd been in before was real, and I didn't want to disobey the new flow that had taken over. I was acting strange in front of the visiting family members, and my mom called the ambulance. My behavior was strange enough that the responders decided to take me to the hospital, and as they were doing so, I broke from the obedience to that pseudo-flow state and started screaming to my mom that there was an ICML paper deadline that I had to submit to. This was still 2020, months after the Psyche-CAM paper. The responders took me away, so far with no concrete reason to do so, but only my mom's call and the superficial strangeness of my behavior.
>
> In particular, what caused my mom to call the ambulance was I was doing stretches on the couch without talking to my relatives when they were talking to me. Then the strange behavior with responders, who I did talk to, and whose questions I answered normally, was that I was slightly reluctant to let them take my vitals — yes. And I quickly did let them take my vitals. They just caught that I had some reluctance and found that suspicious. So they dragged me to the ambulance, and I was screaming to my mom about the paper deadline as they did so. The ambulance drove me to the hospital, where first, they brought me to a lobby.
>
> In the lobby, the nurse pulled me behind a curtain and made me change clothes, and I didn't want to (was slightly reluctant), but she told me I had to. Then she sat me in a wheelchair. A nurse pushed it forward, it ran over my big toe, and I screamed out specifically that my toe was run over. The nurse kept rolling me off, as she and the other nurses all ignored my screaming, in what, surprisingly, didn't break my toe. 
>
> Next, they brought me to an open area filled with other patients, and told me I'd be transferred later that day.
>
> Each day I was told I'd be transferred that day or the next day. I had to sleep there in a chair for a week. The dungeon-like area was full, in every square foot of the open areas, with other patients, who slept on mattresses or also in chairs. The clinicians seemed to forget about me and still had no particular reason for the imprisonment.
>
> Besides the clothes they'd made me change into, I was given only highly processed foods to eat, foods that usually cause eczema, drugs including benzos, and periodic clinical visits from clinicians who could've been mistaken for military interrogators. Clinical authorities.
>
> None of them were consistent or attendant enough to see this, but I was in an increasingly sensitive state, as I was coerced through all of this, knowing-unjustly, and with no normal sleep for a week.
>
> After a week of sleeping in a chair, they transferred me to the geriatric unit (a facility for the elderly) on a different floor, their regular psychiatric units being full.
>
> Finally, they specified a reason for why they were holding me. Apparently my mom said I wasn't eating enough, which she later denied saying. Ironically, I was eating a lot. Usually 5 organic steaks and a salmon every day, about half of my income. I was lectured pretty heavily by a fat woman specialist about how carbs are a necessary part of a healthy diet. That was Winter, 2020/2021, perhaps just before diets like the keto diet gained scientific support, or maybe already after. During that hospitalization, chunks of my hair fell out. The rapid timing was extremely coincidental, so maybe the onset of the hair loss was independent to the hospitalization, or maybe a synchronicity, but most likely exacerbated, because I thought I was in Hell.
> 
> The anxiety was so extreme that my eczema became itchy just from that, if not the food. I ate all of their garbage food. I made special requests, but the diet they provided wasn't more than what you'd expect from hospital food, and always came with an abundance of chocolate Ensures, enough to probably buy a steak honestly.
> 
> Due to Covid, my family wasn't allowed to visit me.
>
> Of all the hospitalizations (excluding aftermath, e.g., benzos trauma), the most traumatic was the geriatric unit one. And not because they ran over my toe with the wheelchair that I was in and ignored my pained screams, nor the enclosed-dungeon area where they made me sleep in a chair for a week, eat stuff I was allergic too, take benzos temporarily again, and share living space amid lots of commotion and tons of people, but because of the geriatric unit they subsequently transferred me to. Old people. People I thought were sketchy. One friend, black guy I shared pudding crackers with at the window later, after, when I managed to get out of my room from the trauma of thinking I was in Hell. Other than that, coldness, Hell-setting, and, while I was still confined to my bed due to the intensity of the earlier dungeon area where they kept saying they'd transfer me to a room later that day and didn't for another week, I was under the delusion in that geriatric unit environment that I was literally in Hell, the beam of red light shining into my window from the neighboring hospital roof, being stuck in a floor with no nature, old lady in the room next door screaming "Oh Christia! Oh Christia!" every day, only plastic and children's colors and an artificial picture painting across from my door. And I had a whole bed and bathroom to myself, but still. The nurses and staff were fine, but the environment was bad.
>
> That was the geriatric unit hospitalization, psychiatric wards were full, ran over my toe, they kept me in an open-room with other patients, and then after like a week of me sleeping in a chair, they transferred me to a geriatric unit, with me unable to leave my bed through New Year's because I thought I was in Hell, once they situated me in that geriatric unit room, no visitors. They had no knowledge of that Hell thinking, nor was that my state of thinking coming into the hospitalization. 
>
> I wasn't risking the tongue trick from before to spit out the benzos. I wasn't in that kind of flow state. But perhaps all of this was my fault because, later, when they gave me a Covid mask, in the geriatric unit, which I don't recall if they did while in the open area with other patients, I got to spit the benzos out into that.
>
> I think they did a Covid test before transferring me, though I don't recall one. I'm just inferring, since it was a geriatric unit (a unit for the elderly). Yes, I recall mention of a Covid test. I don't know if it was before or after the dungeon-area.
>
> To summarize:
> - `My big toe was painfully run over by the nurse, and ignored`, no attention paid, disregarded screaming.
> - `I had to sleep in a chair in a shared open area filled with other patients for a week` with only scary clinical authorities who came around occasionally to interrogate me, drugs handed to me, and `with food mostly only that I was allergic to`, while in an increasingly sensitive state, and `being told I'd be transferred to a room later that day or the next day.`
> - I was transferred to a geriatric unit, with almost nobody my age, and an environment that lacked any nature, with only synthetic plastics, no genuine warmth, and an abundance of chocolate Ensures.
> - `I was lectured about not eating enough carbs, and that was their specified reason for holding me.`
> - `My hair was falling out into my hands and my eczema returned.`
>
> Some crazy-person advice: Clinicians should stop using the expression "I'm gonna take your vitals," because when a patient thinks they're in Hell, that is a terrifying thing to hear. Then they have no choice but to let those clinicians strap them or inject them or whatever, and their mind possibly is tuned to a ritual level of thinking where symbolism has extreme sacred meaning. The symbolism of "vitals" being "taken," in the context of vampyrism or losing a loved one, isn't good. Just a suggestion. 
>
> While drugged with benzos in the enclosed-dungeon area, my brain went from that strange pseudo-schizotypal paranoia I began in to a full blown "I'm literally condemned here forever and this is literally a robot dimension or Hell" state.
>
> Since Winter, 2020/2021, I have not had another serious or psychiatric hospitalization. There was one hospitalization half a year later, in which I was there for half a day, but they neither held me there nor believed there was any psychiatric issue. The geriatric unit hospitalization was traumatizing, but that's not the reason why I successfully avoided future imprisonments. My ability to live with those schizophrenic states (trances, including less trustworthy ones), consciously and drug-free, increased to the point that they aren't schizophrenic states, but unambiguous connections to a deeper wisdom (or, some "intelligence" of some kind, depending what social influences are most authoritatively in my life). [Humans and other cultures have been integrating that wisdom long before hospitals existed.](https://youtu.be/CFtsHf1lVI4?si=c7HOzpchsB2NeP1-) Though this geriatric unit hospitalization isn't a good example, I was and have become pretty good at navigating those states of consciousness and integrating them in the moment, usefully, creatively, and sometimes powerfully.
>
> That appreciation is rarely seen in modern medicine.
>
> Nor Hollywood, even. At the end of [A Beautiful Mind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Beautiful_Mind_(film)), the nobel prizewinner with schizophrenia, John Nash, is depicted as achieving stability by taking his medications. The real John Nash objected to them, and lived pretty much his entire life unmedicated, starting from long before he came up with the work that led to his winning the Nobel Prize. While the movie's depiction is somehow extremely romantic to medical systems, it's inaccurate to the true history of how he surmounted his diagnoses. ["In Sylvia Nasar's book with the same title, on which the film is based, it is clearly stated that Nash stopped taking medication in 1970 because of the way it blunted his intellect. The change was apparently made because the screenwriter, Akiva Goldsman, whose mother was a prominent psychologist, was worried that the film might persuade people to stop taking their medication."](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/jun/02/dont-use-john-nash-schizophrenia-a-beautiful-mind-promote-anti-psychotics) Yes, the film based on a true story might persuade people wrongly. So better fabricate it. ["in a scene [around the time of the character's Nobel Prize nomination in 1994], Russell Crowe explicitly credits his recovery [...] to newer medication. The truth is that Nash stopped taking any medication in 1970. The line is a fabrication, and a conscious one."](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/jun/02/dont-use-john-nash-schizophrenia-a-beautiful-mind-promote-anti-psychotics)
>
> ["Nash described sanity as a form of conformity, and one about which he maintained a degree of ambivalence. 'So, at the present time, I seem to be thinking rationally in the style that is characteristic of scientists,' he wrote. 'However, this is not entirely a matter of joy, as if someone returned from physical disability to good physical health. One aspect of this is that rationality of thought imposes a limit on a person's concept of his relation to the cosmos.' There can be no doubt that to talk in such terms requires both honesty and tremendous courage. The question is whether we have the courage to hear him."](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/jun/02/dont-use-john-nash-schizophrenia-a-beautiful-mind-promote-anti-psychotics)

To do: Make a diagram specifically for geriatric unit hospitalization (University of Rochester's Strong Hospital).

Chronology: Lobby wheelchair toe -> open-area chair sleeping with processed eczema-causing food, more coerced benzos, and interrogative military clinicians -> geriatric unit -> them arguing carbs were a necessary part of a healthy diet and stating that the reason for holding me in that hospitalization was that I wasn't eating enough (even as I ate all of their garbage food).

## Second induced hair loss

Full head hair regrowth in Alopecia Universalis, especially with comorbid eczema, is extremely medically rare. 

By the time of the Psyche hospitalization, I was on a mostly-steak-only diet since at least as far back as June, 2020 (with wild-caught salmon as well), which I remember since at that time I was working on my Psyche-CAM paper, but probably back to May or April.

See [here](4-Faith.md#mikhaila-peterson) for where I'd initially heard of this diet from. Specifically, the diet I heard of and read about was "beef-only."

The first month of that diet included many unwanted but temporary and [expected](https://carnivoresnax.com/blogs/articles/side-effects-of-carnivore-diet?srsltid=AfmBOooxOb6gWQrauNAH3Eqc9rI2AqqSU61Tp1dTbRSRpzqtyBlfsMFP) physical symptoms.

<!--Previous to the final version of my diet, beginning initially from Paleo, I transitioned to (organic) beef-only. The organic-beef-only phase was about a month and caused watery bowel movement symptoms and decreased stool frequency, as were expected from what I'd heard and read about the diet. By the end of that month, I think my energy and mood, and probably cognition, had massively improved. Gradually, the majority of my beef came from organic, grass fed, grass-finished steak and not long after, perhaps in that month as well, I added daily salmon in the morning.-->
Beginning from Paleo, I switched to organic beef-only, which is what I read and heard about, and, within that month or after a month, I added occasional salmon.

My diet converged to about one wild-caught salmon each morning and about 5 organic, grass fed, grass-finished steaks per day, and organic black pepper and salt, and water. I used lots of salt and fried the fat from the steak. 

I experienced big improvements to my cognition, energy, and mood. <!--In particular, I recall my writing, not academic but poems, visual creative writing, and texts to people, had improved that summer to beyond even where they were before the benzo brain damage. Most of my income was going towards this experimental recovering, meant to improve my head from the benzo-induced impairments — and, unexpectedly, my hair started to grow back while on that diet within the next couple months. I was also practicing other disciplines, including meditating, calisthenics, and abstaining from porn, all of which I continued from previous to this diet.-->

In the Psyche hospitalization after the Sarah-one, [Harry](#Harry) remarked on my hair when we saw a Duplumab commercial and I mentioned that the drug made me lose my hair ("oh that's why"). 

I was walking around bravely sometimes, past all the nurses and patients, from my room to the phone without hat. 

As if the Psyche time period wasn't synchronistic enough, it coincided with this miraculous hair regrowth.

<!-- - The causal mechanisms of all of these independent, non-local phenomena don't erase the divergent statistical odds of their synchronous timings. -->
  
- The Psyche hospitalization had given me a lot of junk food and I was eating lots of sweets after, as well, still on the dietary momentum from that hospitalization, even chocolate-chip cookies and cakes and things like that, somewhat addictively. But then I resumed strict discipline and a steak-primarily diet maybe a month or so after. I think steak/salmon-only. Amazingly, my eczema didn't return during the Psyche hospitalization or after, but that break in my disciplined diet, largely induced by the hospital, could've been what caused the sudden hair loss again. <!--Eczema was the reason I couldn't visit Psyche, though I wanted to, but at that point Psyche was seeing other guys, not to mention still living, as I'd learned, with her ex-boyfriend, not the bald Jewish husband.-->
- I even fasted during Psyche, before the Psyche hospitalization, further yet just before my hair started growing back, so strict discipline wasn't what caused it to fall out in December. But fasting is unlikely to have been what caused it to grow back. It was a prolonged fast, about 7 days. I did 3 prolonged fasts in my life. Only that one corresponded (later) with hair regrowth. During that period, otherwise, before and during my hair regrowth, and during Psyche, and before the Psyche hospitalization, I was only doing steak/salmon-only diet strictly.
- See [Intimacy healing](#intimacy-healing) in case Psyche was the reason my hair grew back, though the [next two hair regrowths](#future-hair-regrowths) also coincided with the steak/salmon-only diet.

[In the next hospitalization, in the geriatric unit](#geriatric-unit-hospitalization), there was a guy my age. I sat with him every day towards my last days there at the window. He and I talked. We were talking about deep things. I told him about my self-consciousness about my hair, since chunks of it were falling out again in that geriatric unit, and he said he couldn't even tell anything was bald. I think he even had some balding that he showed me, and said that he loses hair all the time, that my hair looked good, and not to worry. In other words, my hair had fully grown back, enough to pass the eye test of a guy sitting right next to me. *My head hair had fully grown back.*

But, in case the detail was missed ("since chunks of it were falling out again in that [geriatric unit](#geriatric-unit-hospitalization)"), it was there that it turned out to be falling out again, and proceeded to partially for months after, to the point that now it looks worse than it would've had it never grown back. I have to shave it from my head, something I don't like doing, to maintain the bald upper bound of my current mutilated appearance, that otherwise now grows in in patches, with more bald skin than hairy skin. That is exponentially worse than the first time they caused my hair to fall out.

`My hair was induced to fall out again after I regrew it through hard and expensive discipline, resulting in an Alopecia Areata that looks exponentially worse than the previous Alopecia Universalis.`

Despite my self-consciousness, for the most part, I didn't wear a hat during that hospitalization, so many people saw my head. My mom said, "I didn't think you need it" over the phone when I got mad at her for not dropping it off when she dropped off one steak in a plastic Tupperware. I was lectured about not eating enough carbs (which steak doesn't have) by one of the hospital staff. They required I eat carbs for me to be discharged, since they said my diet, was why I was being held, and specifically that my mom told them I wasn't eating enough (which she denied). <!--This requirement was already after the week in the enclosed-dungeon area.-->

My hair was falling into my hands again in the [geriatric unit in December, 2020](#geriatric-unit-hospitalization), most likely because of the practices in that coerced hospital stay or the temporary dietary consequences of the previous coerced hospital stay.

That sudden hair regrowth was, miraculously, more than 2 years after the Dupilumab cessation that induced the Alopecia Universalis, and covered my head.

Anyway, that truth about not intervening while parts are still growing in, is quintuply true about people under 20.

> I met Harry (name anonymized) in the October, 2020 Psyche hospitalization. A couple years later, I learned that Sarah had met Harry in one of their hospitalizations, too, that he'd even braided Sarah's hair. Harry was a recurrent inpatient care unit psychiatric recipient. He was 16, clearly intelligent, had a "sober" intelligence and humor, was respectful, kind, and chill. They'd been giving him benzos for 2 years at that point, on and perhaps-sporadically-off, from the age of about 14, and he was in there mainly, or perhaps only, for drug problems and addiction. Acclimating to benzos, one's brain becomes deprived of GABA and will crave something, usually drugs, to take the literal neural edge off, to silence those disproportionate Glutamates and other action potentials whose balancing complement, GABA, is downregulated, throughout the brain. Benzos are a hard drug, and are as addictive as any hard drug. He was a 16-year-old drug addict, and they kept institutionalizing him for his drug issues and prescribing daily benzos.
>
> Maybe he was such a big alcoholic at the age of 14 that the benzos were the inescapable treatment that the psychiatrists had to resort to, but I doubt it. When it gets to the point that kids are being inoculated with benzos, psychiatrists should ask themselves whether they have a problem, some kind of addiction maybe, to prescribing benzos, and seek help. There is a path to recovery, a 12-step program, starting with (1) stop. (2) Ask yourself, "Will society really be ruined if this kid is helped in some more-substantive way?" The next 10 steps involve reforming society, so I leave that as an exercise to the reader.

These traumas are inflicted on kids, in hospitals and schools alike. Schools, today, are where kids give the best hours of their day. It's where, today, kids obey authority and follow merciless programs, with such stress that the authority and obedience structures disseminate to kids, and create a psychology of competition, mercilessness, and necessitated bullying. Rather than being like summer camps, schools today are literal concentration camps. Hospitals and schools should take inspiration from summer camps (no coercion, social, integrated with nature), monasteries (intuitive aesthetic for peace), and the fact that YouTubers make better educational content through their channels than what most schools offer, except often way faster-to-learn-from and more truthfully/deep/intelligently/respectfully-to-audience/entertainingly when it comes to the learning curriculum, from the intuitions to the in-the-weeds material specifics, that can be curated into many diversely branching tracks, while tools like [Quora](https://www.quora.com) and [Piazza](https://piazza.com/) make learning by oneself, in one's own designed, uncoerced fashion, more possible than ever.

YouTube, Quora, and Wikipedia are how I taught myself physics.

Before that, I took an AP class in high school that I didn't score high enough on to get college credits for, and I took a community college class at Monroe Community College in the summer after my freshman year, that I got an A in, that my university, the University of Rochester, didn’t even matriculate, because it was a community college.

## Future hair regrowths

My pubic hair grew back in 2021 while doing a strict steak/salmon-only diet with some Paleo leniency — it was definitely still grown back while I was doing that diet in December, 2021 — and fell out gradually, as the "Paleo" component of my diet, by the modern less-strict "certified" standard, had more intensely included  high-carb "Paleo" snacks, such as those with dark cocoa, coconut, honey, and nut butter type ingredients, nor was my social life exactly resuscitated. 

Regarding social life, the middle-ground, socially, of having improved working conditions<!--that I had--><!--briefly--><!--increasingly during this time-->, as I was getting relatively high enthusiasm from Chenliang and his lab <!--of all Chinese guys--> for my research work (in particular as I progressed with building my [novel UnifiedML AI framework](https://github.com/AGI-init/UnifiedML-legacy)), maybe wasn’t <!--sufficient-->as plausible a catalyst for the regrowth as that diet. <!--I get this sounds like the "I once had a black friend" trope, but one of the only people I still trust in my life was in that lab, and like many in that lab was supportive and sincere, but stood out for our shared interests and tastes (in particular when it came to philosophy and TV). I'm not sure whether it's an honor or an insult to give him credit for my pubic hair though, though as it happens he joined the lab slightly after that regrowth and loss, and I will simply give that credit to my diet, unless there are any other takers (maybe avoiding this credit is why everyone rejected me at that time!).--> Amid this, the stress was extremely high, as I had to report updates to two labs every week, presenting results and implementations that had to satisfy Chenliang's pretty strict standards<!-- even as his later-year students, who'd been with him for more than 3 years, let alone 1 and a half years, whose original specializations were Computer Vision in their first 3 years, published in Computer Vision venues more often-->.

My eyelashes started growing back for the first time in summer, 2023, when I'd started doing the steak/salmon-only diet again, and my best friend returned best friend returned (like Psyche, only via text) into my life, and fell out shortly after I was terminated, at which time I also had gone more lenient on my steak/salmon-only diet, due to the combination of more stress (from that termination) and lacking an income. Those three eyelashes that had grown back one by one gradually up to that point, that summer, starting that summer, grew back for the first time ever in the 5 full years since losing all of my hair. Then each fell out, but I attribute them to my best friend, who returned that summer, and probably also the correlating steak/salmon-only diet that I'd resumed before his return, earlier in 2023, after the weather had already gotten warm. Though, besides steak/salmon during that period when my eyelashes started to grow back for the first time, I allowed myself organic tea on that one, as well. Then, when I was terminated by this wonderful university of mine that had cost me my hair in the first place, my newly miracle'd eyelashes fell out suddenly.

However, adding this seems to undermine just how severe the injustice we're talking about is.

The bullies at the University of Rochester's hospital and research institutions don't understand that they botched every action they took in their judgments, treatments, policies, decision-making, and (as will be shown, though hopefully it's apparent already) rulings, and did everything humanly possible, sometimes by blunder rather than on purpose, to take away and waste my dignity, money, social life, physical body, and work.

`I was farmed in a factory, physically maimed/mangled/disfigured, and disposed of.`

## Food

> [!TIP]
> ### High quality food in the medical system
>
> - Inorganic factory-sourced industries, whose practices treat animals inhumanely, in compartments in a factory where they never see the light of day and bloat fat with antibiotics, grains, corn, and soy, can be out-competed by organic sources where the cows can graze and live with other cows on pastures, under the sun, ethically, if medical institutions specifically sourced only and more, as part of their patient care, from the latter and generally organic highest-end sources. Living on a grassy pasture with other cows is a good life and not inhumane, in fact better than most hospital environments.
> - Currently, hospitals provide 4 - 5 types of services: tests, drugs, surgeries, personal care (e.g., helping with walking to the bathroom), therapies. High quality food, is not an insignificant omission. Hospitals and health insurances should pay for high quality food. Doctors should gear more towards making high quality food prescriptions, which should be covered by health insurance. Organic food is more closely tied to health*care* than prescription pills, and in the government, food stamps are an independent program linked only to severe economic need and limited in terms of how much is paid for unilaterally, from which organic-food stamps might be inspired, with more financial coverage but more "what kind of food can be ordered" limitation. Medicare currently has online portals, and there are also services like Instacart, for ordering food that can also be inspired from for this purpose, or just a specific debit card that can be used at grocers.
> - 2.4 million years of human evolution in the Ice Age, wherein even Africa had winters and some glacial ice, were followed by the last 11,500 years of the modern epoch. I know nutritionists aren't mathematicians, but 2.4 million is a slightly bigger number than 11,500. On principle, though it may not be the standard consensus, the evolution history that produced our biological consciousness and cognition deserves our reverence. My grandma, my grandma's grandma, her grandma's grandma and so on — yes, back into the Ice Age — are all ancestral roots of wisdom, from whose evolutionary conditions were born our metabolism physiologies.
> - I haven't found any hypothetical risks of my trialed diet to be an issue, but that's why latitudinal studies are needed. I ate fresh rather than frozen, grass fed grass-finished organic, almost always wild-caught rather than farmed, with no other interacting chemicals, besides allowing myself salt and black pepper, and water. The idea that red meat causes anything, has not yet had a standard scientific investigation in the context of organic, grass fed, grass-finished, and wild-caught meat, and controlled for for other interactions, e.g., sauces, sugars, and so on.
> - A proper nutrition study that investigates interacting chemicals, requires a combinatorially intractable number of control variables (and in this case, a lot of money, not so much that the medical system can't afford it, and not so much that humanity's health should have to be sacrificed to scrounge on, but more than usual nutrition studies are funded and invest), rarely accounted for in nutrition studies. This inadvertent study, on a population of me (low-socioeconomic family background, limited to a PhD student income of less-than-official-New-York-State-living-wage), longitudinally, resulted in at least 3 measured breakthrough results, across a span of 6 years (since first injected Dupilumab), and other breakthrough-type results harder to measure around energy, mood, cognition, and neurological functioning, besides hair.

## On the note of synchronicities

- Waxed wise with a close friend ([Jeremiah](#jeremiah)) who I met on a trip to Israel many years back — someone who rather serendipitously was seated next to me on that plane — about reinforcement learning on Facebook, reconnected, and at his birthday party ran into someone who my religious friend (different guy incidentally, Josiah) introduced me to years ago, who I then kept running into the next weeks at the beach literally by just remarkable luck, and each usually-accidental date we had was like a reinforcement learning episode, of me trying to listen to my subconscious and instinct, and getting rewarded or punished and ultimately the world's lowest ever score aside from one much needed hug! We were both RL agents in that one (no not ["reinforcement learning agents"](https://github.com/slerman12/UnifiedMLold2/tree/master/Agents), "real life agents")! The fun never ends.
- The next summer I got another miraculous house situation where this really attractive person my age gave me a house rental without a lease with her lesbian roommate (roommates plural ‘cause girlfriend) and no background checks, where I came up with my [BittleBot idea with the methodology of using YouTube](https://github.com/AGI-init/Tributaries/blob/73e95d5006438f678507d0067025e484e66c6e73/Examples/Sweeps/Bittle.py#L11), and she was like a famous YouTuber, and not even the first talented YouTuber I got to meet (the other one by chance while I was editing [a YouTube video](https://youtu.be/VKoSfmECpx0?si=6PNBfaqbE-iY_GV8) in the park)! Then we never talked again (except the second person who I ran into a few years later, by a [physics-subverting](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41524-023-01164-8) precognitive sense that I can't even describe here, who I talked to around the theme of "fire" just before I wrote [this essay about fire](Philosophy/Fire.md) and Chenliang called me in to notify/"fire" me I didn't get him enough papers — not sure what that would've entailed considering the statistically significant correlations of all of these probably deserving [their own interrogation of p-value](https://github.com/animal-tree/SuspiciousnessofSynchronicitiesAndParanoia/blob/main/quackery.md)).
- Somebody I was texting, who I knew from undergrad, was planning to go to Acadia National Park with me, and that inspired me to call my [rQdia paper](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&as_sdt=0%2C33&q=rqdia&btnG=) "rQdia" (pronounced Arcadia), but that one was on purpose, and it was rejected, and we ended up not going (it's still in the not-really-planned-but-hypothetical books)!

Okay the fun ends. That was the majority of my *good* social life in 2018 - 2024, besides walks with some PhD students and occasionally Jewish high-holiday events, despite trying my best via Meetup, Tinder, nightclubs, going to social events, and social anxiety-reducing disciplines, summarized in two bullet points. Oh wait, Meetup deserves a mention:

- Meetup acquaintances deserve a mention. One of them I met the day after somebody at a nightclub told me, "I'm gonna manifest you a girlfriend. I'm manifesting you a girlfriend. I promise." And I said, "Don't promise," and the next day I met somebody else's girlfriend who temporarily became my friend while she was in Rochester. I also ran into her by accident and she called out to me, somehow remembering my name. And we had common interests. She was my girl-space-friend, sort of, during the few hangouts we had, and had a dream, curiously, of going to an AI conference with me.
- The book club Meetup I went to was great, and we read The Great Indian Novel, by Shashi Tharoor.
- Other Meetups included hiking and bird-feeding and a maze and others, which were great, and volleyball, and I made a friend through that.

## Intimacy healing

Depression, anxiety, PTSD, and [touch starvation](https://youtu.be/4zJXr4jeP5w?si=bQCCeK4_Cxv1MbL1) might be treatable through intimacy. 

> [!WARNING]
> 
> In the hospital-provided housing that Sarah got after the hospitalization, I visited for Thanksgiving. Her neighbor made food, including pork chops and mashed potatoes, that we ate in her neighbor's unit. I brought yams I'd made previously before the invitation.
> 
> Pork is not a metaphor for sex. Yams is not a metaphor for boobs. Thanksgiving is a metaphor for how grateful I was for the good food.
>
> She told me then that she'd had sex with the 50-something year old psychiatric ward janitor while hospitalized, in the psychiatric unit. They got into a relationship afterwards, and she'd broken up with him. 
>
> Through the captivity and drugging of her with benzos, the University of Rochester's Strong Hospital facilitated that.
>
> Benzos act like alcohol, and are incredibly personality-disinhibiting. They're even similar to GHB, also a GABA agonist, but which additionally acts on the GHB receptor. All three reduce consciousness, and predispose a horny person to making bad decisions, or good decisions based on a temporary need induced by confinement.
>
> However, perhaps there is a better alternative for those needs, in (1) treating them, rather than drugs, and (2) in self-treating them, rather than janitors. No drug-captivity-induced date-accident needed.
>
> But I'm sure she's thankful for your services (that's not sarcasm — hospital-provided outpatient housing is one of the most-medical things I've ever seen them do; I had no idea they did that).

I propose a new branch of medicine called intimacy healing, one with an ontology like as follows: communications as a subset of intimacy healing, intimacy healing as a subset of medicine, with overlaps but distinction from sex work. 

Independently, sex work should be legalized, regarded as a subset of fine art, formally and academically, but distinct from intimacy healing, and the branches of medicine and fine art can overlap.

Radical idea, but that's the direction. Humans need each other. Relationships are the most fundamental part of life, more of a basic necessity than food, water, shelter, or drugs.

Perhaps my alternative would've served better, and given her a spiritual, healthy way to resolve a [human struggle](https://www.tiktok.com/@mayte.lisbeth/video/7214069179610041642) that all of us share.

> The full elaboration on this involves socialization workers, relationship healers, and, lastly, touch and sensuality therapists.

## The artificial and synthetic

I'm all for [#SexycareForAll](#intimacy-healing), but that's not quite what I have to say.
- And note, via humans.

The use of drugs, porn, movies, TV shows, and technologies shouldn't be judged or shamed. 

Many people are happy relying on those things, others appreciate the art.

Big pharma companies find value in their mass proliferation re: drugs.

And tech companies find value in their mass proliferation re: porn, fleshlights, dildos.

I'm anti-prohibition. My message is only this: the best experiences of a person's life shouldn't be synthetic. Those experiences should be brought into the real world, for people who want or need them, where the experiences people need and want are available foremost in the real world, via people, sincerely, intimately, and via touch, no matter one's "social class." [Imagine all the people, living life in peace.](https://youtu.be/YkgkThdzX-8?si=YNzRr6gnKtG4jywG)

And that must be understood as distinct from capitalistic drug-like fixes that people pay for.

Intimacy healing is a step towards that, starting with medical institutions.

Step 1: Get physical coercion, other kinds of coercion, threatening, involuntary drugging, and unintelligent drugging out of the process. 

## AI
  
AI has many dangerous applications, from [scamming people](https://www.business-standard.com/world-news/how-deepfake-version-of-elon-musk-became-internet-s-biggest-scammer-124081402000_1.html), to [military uses](https://www.politico.eu/article/robots-coming-ukraine-testing-ground-ai-artificial-intelligence-powered-combat-war-russia/), to [mass survelliance](https://bigdatachina.csis.org/the-ai-surveillance-symbiosis-in-china/#:~:text=With%20regard%20to%20China%2C%20it,data%20acquired%20through%20government%20contracts.) that are being developed in labs with paper quotas and ethics standards like Chenliang's. That pressure to turn out papers by every conference deadline means a lot of research ends up getting farmed out of students before proper thought, care, and consideration to consequences can be given. Many AI research labs currently work like factories, research-paper factories.

## Dyada Slava

My uncle ("dyada") came over, quickly. I interviewed him a bit about his physics method. A company here in America hired him, because he was the only one who knew how to do something, something specific to lens-manufacturing. He was/is an optics physicist. One part of what he did, besides dunking a lens into some liquid to create a gradient, or something like that, was, before he retired in... I think 2022... identifying a certain part of the lens or stage in the process manually.

I told him a neural network could probably do it, with enough training data. So I inquired. He didn't want to share, thought I would find it boring, but I told him "For my PhD." 

Did I intend to do it for my PhD, identity patterns for his physics (specifically, optics) work with neural networks? No. But I was curious and thought maybe I could.

So he described his method to me in detail, and left.

It was cool.

That same work week, Chenliang notifies me by Zoom that he wants me to join Niaz's lab, a Materials Science group that is trying to identify diffraction patterns using neural networks. Diffraction is a standard optics process, whereby light spreads due to obstacles or gaps in surfaces.

It was quite the synchronous timing, but at that point, I was used to synchronous timing, and just believed that the synchonicities must've had a point, especially since I had been developing my own AI/physics-hybrid concept for the last few years. So I gratefully joined Niaz's group for funding, thinking it was purposed, even though it wasn't my choice, since Chenliang made me, even while working alongside his Computer Vision lab primarily.

<!--
My uncle told me about his PhD years in Uzbekistan. His PhD took longer than usual, as he kept having to do work for others, assigned to labs and tasks, as others got PhDs and promotions through his exploited work. 
-->
One other thing my uncle told me was that he spent longer than usual on his PhD, as he kept having to do work for others, and giving others PhDs and promotions, through his exploited work.

<!--
Since being terminated, I came up with a diffraction model that is unified with Einstein in a physics theory I credit to my uncle's spirit, most likely, but it was hard work to sit and learn all the material and derive it, and in this book, I've just included some trace evidence of that knowledge — again, all my work, not my uncle's — [here](Philosophy/Velocity-Addition-Formula.md).

In my fourth year, I was assigned to also work in the Mechanical Engineering group that Niaz (who was a great PI) led. Then in my 6th year, it was still while working half-part there, with Niaz, Chenliang, and team, that Chenliang (who symbolically led the deep learning side of the work, with me leading the deep learning side of the work) called me into his office in the CS building where his lab meetings, including me (both my office and attendance to those meetings, as well), were held, towards which most of my 70-hour-per-week labor was going, to inform me that he didn't think I had enough papers (this was while he knew we were in the middle of a paper-review, a paper on which I had second-author, on which Chenliang, and according to Chenliang, Niaz, had previously offered me first-author — and I rejected — twice — out of fairness to the other PhD student — for a paper that got highly positive reviews), and due to that low number of publications, he would be deserting.

The paper got accepted, after my termination notice and on the day before my last day as an employed student, in fact, synchronistically, a minute after I referenced it in the email I sent shown in the next ["Disproof"](3-Disproof.md#email-10302023) chapter.

Chenliang put me on the Mechanical Engineering lab as the source of my funding, on a project which I led, which was funded by two pretty-major grants that I helped write, which included my ideas, which somehow, by Chenliang's and very-much-not-Niaz's decision, wouldn't fund me any longer.

Niaz, not an "opposing view," and someone I really like, was my other Principal Investigator next to Chenliang. Oh but to be clear, I was still in Chenliang's lab and reporting to that lab as well every week. I was doing extreme amounts of work for both, the latter of which I haven't really started describing yet. 

For Niaz's group, I did a lot of programming, data generation and pipeline-optimizing; much of the systems; idea invention and schematic designing; grant-idea-providing-and-writing-and-diagram-designing; and all of the model building and experiment running and plotting.

In Chenliang's group, I was still trying to do my own research, which was pretty heavily bottlenecked. That's part of why I was practicing every discipline imaginable — from Wim Hof method freezing cold baths to Transcendental Meditation to yoga to strict steak/salmon-only diet to every asceticism I could not-hope for — to achieve the [full scope](https://github.com/AGI-init/UnifiedML-legacy) of what I wanted to do for [both](https://github.com/AGI-init/XRDs).

When Chenliang told me he couldn't be my advisor, I asked Niaz if she could be. She said the process of transferring to the mechanical engineering department formally wasn't that simple, that maybe she could contact the Dean, and that she sympathized sincerely. She also advised that I reach out to the CARE Network, something I at first took some mild offense to, because I messaged her on Slack about the key specifics of the medical institution hair and benzo trauma, and she clarified, no, she meant reaching out to them for a lawyer. I appreciated that. I'm grateful Chenliang forced me on that work because of Niaz. But I did a lot for them in the Mechanical Engineering department, concurrent with my studies in AI separately in his lab, and I had no choice because that project's grants, were funding me, and I helped write two of their big ones (endowing the pretty-small group with upwards of a million dollars), with their names as authors and me uncredited. I did a lot of engineering and data work for them that was independent to my research, that ordinarily would get paid a 6-figure salary for, while I have never been paid more than $15/hr in my life, and the termination left me with tons of student debt.

So you see, because my family was poor, my student debt (for the University of Rochester) was subsidized for as long as I was a student. So when I was terminated, that interest started accumulating, and I had/have to pay them/the lenders the large sum of money (in the above-the-Biden-loan-cancellation ranges, even the Pell grant one I would've gotten). So literally speaking, financially, I was "indebted for their services" for terminating me, which I had to swallow. This is the same University of Rochester I've been describing for multiple chapters now.

Makes me want to go #NotEnoughPapers, for the many thousands of dollars reverse-severance they gave me as gratitude.

However, that lab is the least of the work I did ([here](5-Early-work-in-program.md)/[here](6-Indebted.md)/[here](https://github.com/AGI-init/UnifiedML-legacy)/[here](https://github.com/AGI-init/XRDs)/[here](https://github.com/slerman12/Builder)/[here](https://github.com/AGI-init/Tributaries)/[here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ZQFeiOKSU2teVGg5EHlgREAi8pJY_Mr1CJ3H2pfFBfI/edit?usp=sharing)), at sometimes slave wage by force, with PhD requirements that were usually uniquely put on me, from the same institution that mutilated the hair and youth from my body and face, and neurochemically gassed my brain, then terminated me and scapegoated me for their 6 years of atrocities, negligences, and greed.

They Holocausted me.

They Holocausted me. By whatever legal definition exists, they Holocausted me. Every lawyer agrees, that by whatever legal definition exists, they Holocausted me.

Now rewind in time a bit. Not to the days of the Canaanites, but to the days before Chris Kanan.

Two of my advisors and two of my committee members deserted, for funsies, e.g. sabbaticals (I barely had time for Sabbath), promotions, retirement, funding reallocation, etc., and I was left with a brand new interim committee, consisting of Chenliang Xu, who had just announced his desertion, Charles Venuto, who worked in the Med Center and had no expertise in AI, Chris Kanan, last-minute added interim committee member, and Tom Howard, last-minute added interim committee member.

I never effectively met half of my committee, we had one 20-minute Zoom call in which I presented, and then an after-room discussion.

In defense of the committee members who agreed on the decision, most of them didn't know me and hadn't met each other or me previously, and one of them, Chris Kanan, in a kind of *deus ex machina* (or so I thought, since that should have conclusively settled it), [mis-remembered](https://github.com/slerman12/BrokenWisdoms/blob/Ancillary/Deus-Ex-Memory.md) the short Zoom meeting that the four of us had (I highly recommend clicking on that link), on which these decisions from their end were based, as being 1.5 hours and twice. That is quite a lapse in memory (and Chris Kanan is the youngest). The meeting was 30 minutes, and once, as the other committee members may recall and confirm. The calendar invitation that that committee member, Chris Kanan, accepted, wrote: "Friday May 5, 2023 ⋅ 1pm – 1:45pm (Eastern Time - New York)" (extra lag time added). I have on email to one committee member Tom Howard that we planned half an hour: "Would you be available any of the following dates for a half-hour remote 6-month review?" It can be confirmed that it was 30 minutes in which I had to summarize 6 years of work over Zoom: 20ish minutes spent on my presentation, then 5ish minutes for their independent-room discussion and 5 minutes for their concluding remarks. 

I should add details about the work that Chris Kanan asked me to do, or suggested rather, that I followed through on. Maybe in this [chapter](3-Disproof.md) and [this one](6-Indebted.md), but see terminator-bubble-diagram immediately above and I'll summarize below.

Long-term memory is what I was working on longest. From the Spring semester of my Freshman year, 
- when I built a long-term episodic memory reinforcement learning controller on top of image features from Felzenshwalb segmentation in Chenliang Xu's machine vision class,
- to that semester where I actually did meet Tom Howard for 5 minutes and told him about using the idea for robotics when we went to his robotics lab because he took an interest (and that short exchange is the only time I talked to him prior to this),
- to email-record (e.g. with Prof. Len Schubert),
- as well as my area exam,
- as well as my thesis proposal,
- as well as what I was doing at the Med Center that Charles Venuto has email record and maybe memory of,
- up to even this meeting with the new committee, where I showed [all of what I had done on that (lifelong, adaptive, rewritable, growing, accelerated Replay Memory for use in RL or supervised learning or generative modeling) and more](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ZQFeiOKSU2teVGg5EHlgREAi8pJY_Mr1CJ3H2pfFBfI/edit?usp=sharing).

Coincidentally, they all had evidence that this is something I was trying to do through my full PhD, and *for some reason* — I'll let you guess why — maybe didn't get to. Everybody wanted me to pursue their different independent area research. Except Chris Kanan. Who suggested, wisely, after that 20-minute Zoom meeting, by email one month after I delivered a big new research proposal as they insanely requested, that I develop a brand new reinforcement learning systems algorithm for my giant built-from-scratch deep learning library/framework [UnifiedML](https://github.com/slerman12/Builder), and I did within two months ([here is one of the commits](https://github.com/slerman12/Builder/commit/e8b896c75bdeb388995af912a25108dfa16a92f9) when I finished implementing [it, sampling without replacement within a priority, accelerated, parallelized, hard-disk-memory-mappable Replay Memory using truly-shared RAM memory, dynamically growable and rewritable and unified with supervised and generative modeling](https://github.com/AGI-init/UnifiedML/blob/ef14f7ff14b0b494d14bc8ee4bfe8925ad2a1fb3/ML/World/Replay.py#L566-L607), innovating on the state of the art reinforcement learning algorithm/system DrQV2, which very much does not do the vast majority of those things), the day before the meeting with Chenliang, when I told him about my algorithm/system in [my UnifiedML framework](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ZQFeiOKSU2teVGg5EHlgREAi8pJY_Mr1CJ3H2pfFBfI/edit?usp=sharing) — and it actually is brilliant — and he liked it dismissively, then proceeded to tell me he couldn't be my advisor because I didn't have enough papers. It was a good meeting, but he didn't know what he was doing.

It is the first rewritable DataLoader that serves as a Replay for supervised, generative, and reinforcement learning as well as the novel algorithm for sampling without replacement, something that is standardly done in the former two but had never been done for priority experience replays in the latter, especially not in combination with lifelong storage capacity via [dynamic device allocation](https://github.com/slerman12/Builder/blob/64c92d7bf5c09642e161548c36625739884b01f7/UnifiedML/src/ML/World/Memory.py#L103-L107), [hard disk memory mapping](https://github.com/slerman12/Builder/blob/64c92d7bf5c09642e161548c36625739884b01f7/UnifiedML/src/ML/World/Memory.py#L524-L543), and [truly-shared in-RAM adaptive memory](https://github.com/slerman12/Builder/blob/64c92d7bf5c09642e161548c36625739884b01f7/UnifiedML/src/ML/World/Memory.py#L59-L150), in other words though extremely reductive: an accelerated parallelized DataLoader whose contents can be changed by the agent, and which include generalized sampling methods even when the dataset size is growing such as in a priority experience replay for DataLoader, and all of this added with a truly state of the art reinforcement learning algorithm/system DrQV2 as well as others with support for continuous and discrete domains, online or offline learning, and on-policy or off-policy, all of which — yes, all of which — I generalized into a unified API and framework to fully support supervised, generative, and reinforcement learning, the most general DataLoader/Experience Replay/Memory ever built, capable also of storing and updating parameters, not just data, meaning all of this with support for deep neural Memory, not just dataset-centric. Nothing like it exists — I'm afraid PyTorch or somebody will try to copy it upon reading this. The value of it was so immense and this brand new interim committee — all except Chris Kanan — had not the faintest scent of that — well, that's not true, Chenliang thought I could start a business and just cared about papers, but note, I needed his GPUs to finish. By the way, pretty much fully implemented, [and elegantly so](https://github.com/slerman12/Builder/blob/main/UnifiedML/src/ML/World/Memory.py) (but with no GPUs to finalize the small amount of work left on the library/framework as a whole, nor funding or undestroyed-human-spirit left to write the immense amount of documentation still needed, and personally, I think this book takes priority, not to mention, I've released all the code open-source under the MIT license, so traditional funding routes aren't an option anyway, plus I have other interconnected plans for my research, if given the reigns/money-rains to make it happen). Since I started building it for my PhD (from about 2021, in Chenliang's lab, onwards), some similar works have come out, like PyTorch's entire reinforcement learning library, but none compare (the system was being built within a GATO/JEPA-type framework before either of those were published/announced). And has an [interface that plug-and-play substitutes the normal PyTorch DataLoader](https://github.com/slerman12/Builder/blob/main/UnifiedML/src/ML/World/Replay.py). It's also accelerated and faster in every substantive way for supervised, too, at least Pytorch's default DataLoader, but possibly the more intricate accelerators, and was the first infrastructure in Chenliang Xu's Computer Vision lab [capable of training ImageNet efficiently from scratch](https://github.com/slerman12/Builder/blob/main/tributaries-ml/src/tributaries/Examples/Sweeps/ImageNet.py), something not one other student in his Computer Vision lab — even with the most published papers — had (and probably "has" as of time of writing) ever done. To be clear, I was the first student in his PhD lab's history — officially ranked one of the [top in the world in Computer Vision](https://csrankings.org/#/fromyear/2020/toyear/2024/index?vision&us) — to use any infrastructure (his or otherwise) for training ImageNet from scratch (meaning, not via fine-tuning an ImageNet-pre-trained model, nor just using a subset of the ImageNet dataset), the gold standard of his field, all within a GATO/JEPA type generalized (and more general than either of them) framework (whose construction also preceded both of those, by the way). That being said, his students, perhaps more so than Chenliang, appreciated what I was doing, though Chenliang knew it could've been valuable, and was good enough for a PhD. Both he and Niaz said I was ready to defend. Chenliang wanted me to write my thesis before he cut his funding, yet again on an impossible deadline. But a thesis is more important than a conference paper, and I couldn't have.

## Rituals, Religion, & Hell

> Move ths chapter to 4-Faith.md. Include story about time I had to retake a grad-level systems class, on account of getting a tiny fraction of a point below B, and the professor, having decided my research wouldn't independently involve enough systems work, chose to not give me that tiny fraction of a point, so I ended up with a B-, the CS department PhD program requires a B or higher, and I had to take a whole semester of grad-level systems again, systems being my least favorite subfield of CS, and ended up mostly teaching the class anyway since it had to do with a topic that would, later, end up being taken over by AI. Chris Kanan, having suggested I implement a novel RL systems algorithm for my research, and me actually having done so in a 2 month time span, a huge, insane amount of work, disproved that earlier professor, and puts the school in debt for my retaking a grad-level systems class, and the teaching I did for it.

One of the most powerful rituals was during the Psyche hospitalization. When they first brought me in, before the psychiatric unit, I was held in some various different rooms. One of them, was part of a hallway where there was a male nurse sitting outside, who looked just like my best friend. He even had a nametag that I think was my best friend's first name, so I vaguely recall. I knew it wasn't my best friend, but somehow led him in a ritual, that he willingly participated in. The state I was in was shamanic. He was about my age and let me speak to him as if I was speaking to my best friend, as he literally went along with sitting on the floor, since I was playful and had unambiguous humor and self awareness in my voice, but had some "commanding" flying colors. I understood the nurse wasn't literally him, my best friend who I projected lucidly-but-not-fully-intentionally.

Later, as I walked along that hallway — I don't know if it was a psychiatric unit or what — I was the only patientin the hall  and there were many nurses — I kind of led the female nurses in a ritual, too. Each one I saw, I looked into her eyes and said the name of the family member or friend who I saw in them, as if literally my family was appearing in them in spirit. I was seeing beyond them individually, and they sensed it. At one point, I even put my hand slowly to one female nurse's rib, intimately and non-sexually. She stood still. All of the nurses stood still. There was even a big male nurse. 

A ritual was happening that couldn't be desecrated or remarked upon. No clinical logic could destroy it.

The theme of my best friend returned in the next hospitalization, in the geriatric unit (elderly facility) one, where I imagined him as the Devil, but that schizophrenic-like delusion was the least Hellish thing about that hospitalization, and I thought I was literally condemned in Hell, literally in Hell and I would never see humanity or good again. Having somebody I can trust — despite being imagined — play the role of the most fearful part of that trauma, made the actual Hellishness of that hospitalization less Hellish. The delusion, in spite of the environment, was good.

It's the delusion that doctors and hospitals are trying to heal. However, in that example, it was the doctors and hospital who were creating a Hell, and the delusion was the only healing part of it. In that delusion, he was quite snarky.

Later, my best friend returned, literally. We were texting and he remarked, without prompt, saying if he were a Devil, he'd be a "snarky Devil." He texted me that of his own accord, knowing nothing about the hospitalization, no context, no prompt.

That was a small amount of evidence that some communication, message-passing (without known mechanical means), happened non-locally.

</p>

The independent-room discussion reasonably marked the end of my portion of the meeting, or so I thought. However, after the independent-room discussion, we kept talking, I left, and Chenliang later told me that the committee members thought I dropped the line early. That was a misunderstanding. I really thought the meeting was over since they conveyed everything I had to do next, or at least that they were going to in that discussion. At the very, very end of the discussion, one of the committee members, Tom Howard, said, "I just want to add, I think it's important." I actually in my sleep deprivation thought he meant my work (I suspect he probably meant the chapter-list), so I did a sincere and prolonged "bless you" sign with my hands in the silence and left. I know that this is the least believable part. Chenliang knew via Slack I hadn't slept that whole night, due to insomnia and maybe-nervousness, and I mentioned that "I didn't sleep all night" during the meeting to which I think Tom Howard off-handedly, maybe-non-noticedly said "I know," before resuming his point. 

Chenliang had to take his dog to the vet, for that matter. Either his wife did or him, but the meeting had to be no more than half an hour by what he told me. How we scheduled, over Slack. 
- If I left early, it's further justified by what Chenliang wrote to me on Slack, about needing to take his dog to the vet immediately after the meeting, assumed 30 minutes, his wife possibly being able to do it, or otherwise having to reschedule the vet to later in the day, all of which probably can be verified with either his vet or his wife or just his calendar.

He (Tom Howard) concluded the meeting saying "I just want to add, I think it's important" in reference to the chapter-list, and I did a "bless you" sign with my hands, as I'd on previous occasion felt the need to do after a robotics-related pitch to Chenliang's group coincidentally, in-person in Chenliang's lab, and robotics is Tom Howard's field. That was a coincidence though. It was just a vivid moment in Chenliang's lab, with all of his students there as witnesses, when he agreed to buy me one of the $300 Bittle robots that I could use with the robotics software that I [built](https://github.com/AGI-init/tributaries/blob/main/Examples/Sweeps/Bittle.py), that I did a "bless you" sign for in gratitude. I meant it in a similar way to Tom Howard, but I interpreted "I just want to add, I think it's important" as being in reference to my research, not the chapter-list.

The chapter-list was the only requirement they wanted to make in that meeting. We had the entire after-independent-room discussion and they didn't specify anything other than the chapter-list. I'm sure they weren't going to. Perhaps one of them can even confirm that nothing more than the chapter-list was discussed as extra requirement in their independent-room meeting. That was clear from context.

But afterwards, I got an email — I think from Chenliang and perhaps from the graduate coordinator — specifying two altogether different requirements, with only an auxiliary mention of the chapter-list. Here they were, as apparently decided by the committee (post-hoc) after their chapter-list decision in the actual six-month review:

> ### $\Huge &#8220;$
> As remediation, the committee asks the student to
>
> 1.   before June 5, 2023, provide a 1-page write up that addresses the problem statement, hypothesis, and approaches of the thesis and give an outline of thesis chapters,
> 2.    before August 30, 2023, re-do and pass a six-month review.
> ### $\Huge &#8221;$

It's ironic that I'm being asked for remediation.

I don't know who decided these extra requirements, if it was the CS chair Michael Scott, or Tom Howard, or Chris Kanan, or even Chenliang.

I delivered a 6-page write up, as well as a chapter-list, as well as a 1-page write up summary in the 6-page write up, meeting all of the requirements of (1) for this brand new interim committee that effectively never met me. 

Subsequently, Chris Kanan suggested that I innovate a new reinforcement learning systems-based algorithm (also suggesting it post-hoc), which I did, as I described [above](#chris-kanan).

These are enormous requirements that I met on their behalf.

Tom Howard didn't make any tangible, explicit, or otherwise suggestions, nor did my advisor or Charles. (The committee consisted of 4 people, my advisor Chenliang, Chris Kanan, Tom Howard, and Charles).

The actual six-month review was **May 5th, 2023**. Then Chenliang notified me of his desertion on **July 24th, 2023**, a day after I finished implementing the [novel reinforcement learning systems-based algorithm](https://github.com/AGI-init/UnifiedML/blob/ef14f7ff14b0b494d14bc8ee4bfe8925ad2a1fb3/ML/World/Replay.py#L566-L607) (and [here](https://github.com/slerman12/Builder/commit/e8b896c75bdeb388995af912a25108dfa16a92f9) is the specific commit), and Chenliang confirmed by email the desertion for the rest of the committee and Michael Scott on **August 10th, 2024**, the same day as my [early in-advance-of notice](https://github.com/slerman12/BrokenWisdoms/blob/Ancillary/Not-Enough-Carbs.md) to the committee and Michael Scott that, on account of that, I wouldn't attend the requirement (2), notified to them without their "no" prior to the **August 30, 2023** date, with Chenliang even specifying that I was ready to defend a thesis within the next few months.

I have to elaborate more on Charles since he was on my six-month review committee.

Charles was still on my committee from the Med Center years, but was about to be replaced after this latest six-month review by my PI of the last several years [Niaz](#niaz-abdolrahim) (the work for whom was funding me), as she agreed.

Charles was my Med Center advisor. Charles and Henry both oversaw me in those first 3 years, before Henry's promotion meant I had to switch into Chenliang's lab and start an altogether new Computer Vision-branch focus of research, with an ultimatum to submit a top-venue paper that summer *in* Computer Vision, literally a brand new field to me. And I did. Amazingly. Though that seems to be unappreciated (the benchmarks and conventions for actual acceptance, though not necessarily principle of concept, are more elaborate than just plopping MHDPA on top of a CNN, had I done that). However, the [explainability-centric paper that I came up with, derived, wrote, and programmed](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.08601) would not have been my preferred research area, since I was working on MHDPA and long-term episodic memory methods for Charles in the Med Center (and Henry) prior to that, and wrote [my novel MHDPA method paper](https://www.overleaf.com/read/qgmmzgsrctmg#6cd1b9) before MHDPA had any popularity or renown outside of small groups at DeepMind. MHDPA, for the uninitiated, became the backbone, 4 years later, of foundation models like ChatGPT. Henry doubted my obsession with the method back in 2018. No one at the university heard of it. And when switching to Chenliang's lab, he wasn't too thrilled with the idea of applying it to Semantic Image Segmentation, in what would've been perhaps (with some rarely-credited DeepMind experiments at the time having already done it on CNNs as the exception) the first Vision Transformer (since it would've had to convincingly beat baseline scores on Computer Vision benchmarks, which those DeepMind experiments hadn't applied the method on, and rarely are given the credit, despite unified principle of concept). So instead, under an employment-contingent ultimatum, I co-wrote my ICCV [Psyche-CAM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.08601) paper under Chenliang with Henry and Charles. Charles and I managed to sneak biomedical modeling into the appendix (see Appendix J, rather invisible).

I credited Charles as co-author on that paper, however they at the Med Center did not credit me for the prototype of the disease prognostication [model]((https://github.com/slerman12/DiseaseModeling)) (since developed since that original version that won in the PPMI contest, mentioned early [above](#charles-venuto)) and [website]((https://github.com/slerman12/DiseaseModelingWebApp)) I came up with, had to argue for, built, and presented in DC in front of renowned Parkinson's disease researchers, a poster and live demo presentation that also wasn't credited (and not to mention was still amid the very peak of my benzo withdrawal, that I had to take a benzo for to present).

I haven't spoken to Charles since we added that biomedical component to my [Psyche-CAM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.08601) paper and he didn't say a word during the six-month review. I mean not a word, except — maybe — hi, and his video was off. That's 1/4 of the deciding committee, whose decision hinged on that meeting (on whose decision around that meeting determined my termination), who didn't have his video on or say a word during the deciding meeting. The other two were brand new interim replacements for other committee members who were absent. So that just leaves my advisor Chenliang, who didn't want to terminate me, who just wanted to reallocate my funding from the Mechanical Engineering group due to not enough papers in his Computer Vision group, and who believed my research was satisfactory enough to defend that month (of my termination), if I just "followed [his] formatting instructions" for the thesis that I hadn't started writing, that he thought I could write quickly.

So in other words: Chris Kanan (who [didn't remember the meeting](https://github.com/slerman12/BrokenWisdoms/blob/Ancillary/Deus-Ex-Memory.md)) and Tom Howard fully determined my termination, besides Michael L. Scott.

> The [eczema this is presently giving me](https://github.com/slerman12/BrokenWisdoms/blob/Ancillary/Eczema.md) as I type is severe. My arms are scathing red. I'm itchy and can't sleep, rolling around under my blankets in a burning panic, nails grinding to skin on arms, trying to shed the stress from this inflicted evil of judgment. The reader's possible mixed perceptions in my head, all the ways this could be re-done to be made more convincing and believed haunting the scorching thought rivers. Like ants on my arms literally, burning rivers as blood, my arteries need to be dug of their hidden psychological poison, my brain says; my brain pierces and threatens as it sends those coursing swarms stingingly down the lengths of my typing limbs, even now, as I try to put that burning disturbing pleasure and agony into words, if not the claws of my nails where skin residue bulks and swells. Please reader in the hidden ether, stop doing this to me. Send love, not this terror of threat and divided consciousness that broils as war between my body and the depths of my mind and senses.

> The torment doesn't stop until I finish this. I'm slave driven by my skin, as I was by my advisors, committees, and professors. I fear that you are all so stupid, that none of you will see the truth of this, that you will act as allies to the contagion that plagues my stress rather than as people who know the heart no matter the veil or law of land or powers that be.

Maybe one of the strongest Opposing Views, which the remainder of this book will be devoted to obliterating is the CS department Chair who comes in at this point for the first time in my PhD, Michael L. Scott (The Messenger as he'd might've called himself), or: The Judge.

His Opposing View is only strong because of its window of context. Unlike Chenliang and Charles, he didn't know me. Unlike Chris Kanan, he wasn't in my field. And unlike Tom Howard, he didn't and couldn't have even been relevant to a six-month review, since he had no background or expertise whatsoever in anything relevant to the future of his field (to be fair) or mine. The future of his field is my field, for that matter.

That makes him an extremely strong Opposing View.

Michael made a lot of false allegations prior to and after terminating me, in fact almost entirely false allegations, entirely false or hypocritical allegations. For most of the time, his belief was that he was terminating me for more serious reasons than the six-month review make-up. He believed my research was inadequate, "unviable," and that I had to propose a new research "plan." "Plan" — in one's 6th year when advisor and PI already believed I could defend on the work that I had that month.

My advisor and PI weren't right, because I needed peace to write my thesis. That's where Michael's exercise in unearned ruling authority (over me anyway) was the most extreme.

And suspicious.

I call this the Termination Slam.

His previous email read:

> ### $\Huge &#8220;$
> If I do not hear from you by 6 Oct., with a plan for successful completion, the department will terminate your stipend and discontinue your enrollment as of 31 Oct. 2023.
> ### $\Huge &#8221;$
> &ensp;&ensp;- **09/25/2023**

In other words, 'Send the department my "new research plan" (despite the advisor and PI believing I was ready to defend) by **10/06/2023**, now an added independent requirement to the previously delivered materials to the independent six-month review committee.'

Then I delivered another research plan, with precision and accuracy, by the specified date **10/06/2023**. 

This was the only reply I got, of **10/12/2023**:

> ### $\Huge &#8220;$
> Dear Sam:
>
> Thank you for your note of 6 Oct.  I have conferred with members of your committee.  They confirm that the plan you outline is neither consistent with what you originally proposed for the PhD nor a viable path to completion of the degree.  With regret, we will be terminating your student status and stipend as of the end of October.

I delivered what was requested and he put his boot down on my sincerity and effort. That boot despite what was threatened and said is why it was a Termination Slam, not just a termination. On personal and highly elaborate work that was sent to him (and CC'd Chenliang) about all of my research, and the plan to defend after I write my thesis.

Later, he specified the detail he didn't like. No no, it wasn't the research-related material, as he later self-contradicted, it was my request for "peace" towards the end.

However, this alone does not damn Michael. He was CC'd on or I sent him, *all* of the context. At first, he got the [medical context](https://github.com/slerman12/BrokenWisdoms/blob/Ancillary/Not-Enough-Carbs.md) and only the research "context" from the brand new interim committee, later the research context, and gradually he realized that his only justification for the termination — despite what he previously specified — was a measly six-month review make-up, the one that was post-hoc both with respect to advisor desertion and requirement (which I warned [on **08/10/2023**](https://github.com/slerman12/BrokenWisdoms/blob/Ancillary/Not-Enough-Carbs.md) I wasn't going to attend, that Michael was CC'd for), and which is a formalism that isn't under any ordinary PhD circumstance considered that important.

But at that point he stayed doubled down.

The boss battle was over, and I lost.

Michael doesn't know this, but in the systems class I took with him in undergrad, he gave me the lowest grade I've ever gotten in any class, ever, kindergarten through PhD, in a systems class, and I do not like systems (not the coercive kind anyway). He even bumped it up a very-very little. Now Michael ultimately relayed the ruling to terminate, on the "basis" of the committee, and not one, but, as he claimed, [two](7-Ongoing.md) six-month reviews ([and this make-up!](7-Ongoing.md)). Michael mentioned the possibility of applying for reinstatement, though what that means is unclear, especially as: Did he mean I needed to find yet another advisor, new source of funding, re-take a six-month review, do my thesis, and do all of this still recovering from traumas in my 6th year, for less than New York State's legal living wage, or no pay, within the next one to few months? 

See "Slavery or impossible" [here](3-Disproof.md) (in the next chapters) for elaboration on what was demanded on me *together with* the six-month review make-up.

For all of the aforementioned reasons, and final, I was terminated without degree. 6 years of the hardest work the university has ever seen thrown away and spit on, with no accountability, from the same single monopoly and institution that induced multiple medical malpractices on me, mutilated me into looking like Gollum literally, and put me through a literal physiological coerced burning hellfire for more than a year that can't be described. Meanwhile, those years in the program involved two advisors leaving due to no fault of my own, having to work in the Medical Center and Mechanical Engineering department for funding, and a quarter to a half a year as I worked for Chenliang for free.

These are just words. He didn't acknowledge anything I said, separately or together. He occasionally wrote that he disagreed with the characterization, and made no argument as to why.

### Summary of why interim

The committee that terminated me was a brand new *interim* committee, for just one meeting, for which they post-hoc wanted a make-up before the next one that they wouldn't even attend. 

Since I had to switch advisors, and my PI Niaz agreed to be on my defense committee instead of Charles (by my advisor's suggestion just prior to the six-month review), and another committee member was returning, and assuming my old advisor would still remain on the committee, that means the entire brand new committee (3/4 members) — including all of the ones who made the termination decision and ruled that I needed a new research "plan" in my 6th year — were leaving. After that one 30-minute video call, they assumed all governing power over my studies, labor, and employment, simply because other faculty members left without warning (abandoned/deserted their "posts") last-minute. More egregiously, in case that doesn't stress it, 2/4 of them (3/5 if you count Michael) aren't in my field and have no background or expertise in my field. The only 1/4 who did, next to my advisor, was Chris Kanan, the one who provided the [Deus Ex Memory](https://github.com/slerman12/BrokenWisdoms/blob/Ancillary/Deus-Ex-Memory.md) in which he forgot the meeting, and on whose behalf I invented a new RL systems algorithm in less than 2 months during this 3 month period. 

That's the whole story, and where in there is even the slightest administrative sense or rational mandate to make life-altering decisions?
