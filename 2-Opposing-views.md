# Opposing views

The opposing view in defense of my university-hospital doctor is, she might have had something else going on. Or, equivalently, I can only guess she was too busy. But when she took pictures of the hair loss with her nurse there present and diagnosed it honestly as alopecia universalis due to the sudden cessation of Dupilumab, she was kind and genuinely well-intentioned. The opposing view in defense of Aetna, the university-provided health insurance company, is: they, uh, maybe didn’t notice that I had already been on the drug for a long time (I don’t remember the exact duration but between 6 months and 1 year) and, wanted to save money. In defense of the university intermediaries who were in charge of providing and delivering the drug on the prescribed recurring schedule, they couldn’t contact the doctor and the doctor might have had other things going on, because she was nowehere to be seen or reached, nor the health insurance in complying with the intermediating deliverer, whointermediated with me. As mentioned, the doctor, Lisa Beck, was honest in directly diagnosing the rapid loss of my hair to the sudden cessation of Dupilumab and taking pictures with her nurse. 

I should add one for the doctors who coerced the benzodiazepine prescriptions and brain damaged me. I have to leave it out because it is truly traumatic.

In defense of Chenliang: he eventually accepted me into his lab after Henry left, pressured me into writing a paper sooner, and stayed generally nice throughout the time, while not expressing judgement towards my social anxiety. He sometimes had a good understanding of AI. His spirit, sometimes, had promised me many things. He contradictorily seemed to respect my slower publication pace while I built UnifiedML, and I believed he fully knew that I was intelligent enough to warrant investing faith in. Also, 2 publications in 3 years is (I think) less than his average student. That was, however, his reason for terminating me.

In defense of the committee members who agreed on the decision, most of them didn't know me and hadn't met each other or me previously, and one of them, in a kind of *deus ex machina* (or so I thought, since that should have conclusively settled it), [mis-remembered](https://github.com/slerman12/Detective-Sam/blob/main/4-Faith.md) the short 30-minute Zoom meeting that the four of us had, on which these decisions from their end were based, as being 1.5 hours and twice. That is quite a lapse in memory. The meeting was 30 minutes, and once, as the other committee members may recall and confirm, or as I believe is standard among other PhD students. And, the calendar invitation that that committee member, Chris Kanan, accepted, wrote: "Friday May 5, 2023 ⋅ 1pm – 1:45pm (Eastern Time - New York)" (with some customary/informal lag time). Also, I have on email that we planned half an hour: "Would you be available any of the following dates for a half-hour remote 6-month review?" So, as can be easily confirmed or sufficiently evidenced, it was indeed 30 minutes with our brand new committee in which I had to summarize 6 years of work over Zoom: 20ish minutes spent on my presentation and the remaining on their independent-room discussion and concluding remarks. The independent-room discussion reasonably marked the end of my portion of the meeting, or so I thought. However, after the independent-room discussion, we kept talking, I left, and Chenliang later told me that the committee members thought I dropped the line early. That was a misunderstanding. I really thought the meeting was over since they conveyed everything I had to do next, or at least that they were going to in that discussion. At the very, very end of the discussion, one of the committee members, Tom Howard, said, “I just want to add, I think it’s important.” I actually in my sleep deprivation thought he meant my work (I know he probably meant the chapter-list), so I did a sincere and prolonged “bless you” sign with my hands in the silence and left. I know that this is the least believable part. Chenliang knew I hadn’t slept that whole night, due to insomnia and maybe-nervousness, as I let him know prior to the meeting and on previous circumstances through Slack, and I mentioned that I "didn't sleep all night" during the meeting to which I think Tom Howard off-handedly, maybe-non-noticedly said "I know," before resuming his point. Since Charles Venuto was the only person on the committee who knew me since I began the program, when I worked for him in the Medical Center in my undergrad and in the [first 3 years](https://github.com/slerman12/Detective-Sam/blob/main/5-Early-work-in-program.md) of my PhD, including at one point as my funding source for my PhD even as I worked for free for Chenliang, I reassured him via email, without prompt, not to worry, out of that same sincere/maybe-naive kindness that I suspect is hard to believe. The other previous committee members, from those first 5 years [of my PhD](https://github.com/slerman12/Detective-Sam/blob/main/6-Indebted.md), had not been available for reasons that had nothing to do with me. After the meeting, I was formally sent two requirements, one with a June 5th deadline and another with a August 30th deadline. In addition to that, committee member Chris Kanan made recommendations on email that I innovate some new systems-level algorithm for UnifiedML, to give it more of a weight. It was a good suggestion. I not only did this and reported it to Chenliang later, but also met the first deadline sufficiently, with a much longer page-count. Independent to that meeting, and prior to any confrontations or missed required deadlines, Chenliang stated that he would no longer support me in the Fall due to not enough papers, on July 24th. I achieved 2 papers in the 3 years under Chenliang. On August 30th, I missed the second formal requirement, matching another time that I missed such a requirement due to highly extenuating and excused circumstances.

Now, in defense of Michael, the messenger:

Michael, bumped my grade up in undergrad. Wasn't judgmental, sent a "talk?" email, inviting an offer to meet with him and one of the deans, Nick Vamivakas, though he didn't reply to my acceptance to meet, as quoted: (1) "I would be glad to meet in person, but I ask that you restore my stipend for the month of November. Thank you.", and (2) "Hi Michael, I’d be willing to meet. But please extend my stipend through November." (not relevant, but my birthday's in November). Michael had also given one other invitation to meet previously. I replied somewhat infuriated to that one and shared really personal information about my family's accustomment to injustice, threatening a $542 million lawsuit. He replied kindly, understanding my pain, and didn't message again the invite until the October "talk?" email (October 20th), not that I was offended by the invite, to be clear, but rather the revisitted and unaddressed university-inflicted trauma I relayed to all of them. By October, my emails had become harsher, having revisitted a lot of trauma re-summarizing the medical malpractice and other situations that still have not been addressed by any faculty member or the university. I also warned him that I was going to [email the CS grad department](https://github.com/slerman12/Detective-Sam/blob/main/3-Grads-Alliance.md) 3 days before I did. He tolerated my emails as I tried to defend myself, but ultimately chose to terminate, on the basis of the committee, and not one, but, as he claimed in a formal and completely appropriate veer of inoffensible surreptitiousness, [two](https://github.com/slerman12/Detective-Sam/blob/main/7-Ongoing.md) six-month reviews. Michael mentioned the possibility of applying for reinstatement, though what that would've meant is unclear, especially as: Did he mean I needed to find yet another advisor, new source of funding, re-take a six-month review, do my thesis, and do all of this amid health issues in my 6th year, for less than New York State's legal living wage, within the next one to few months or be terminated? 

One more concern Michael raised was that I didn't reply for a long time to Chenliang's email. The reason why wasn't obvious, and I should've sent this sooner, but I specified it eventually both to the committee/Michael and later referenced it in the [email to the CS grad department](https://github.com/slerman12/Detective-Sam/blob/main/3-Grads-Alliance.md). Chenliang blatantly lied in the email that I didn't reply to and betrayed me worse than he did already. Chenliang lied, as soon as I sent [my first email](https://github.com/slerman12/Detective-Sam/blob/main/4-Faith.md), to the entire committee and Michael, something I did not mention here yet, or elaborate on. He did indeed distort truth about something, non-negligible, and really gaslight-ingly. I can't, it's a complete fabrication phrased extremely formally almost as if it's impregnable, an utter truth barrier of defenses. But a lie: "Dr. Niaz Abdolrahim delivered my message to you [... that] I can continue to provide funding support (Sep, Oct, Nov)." No, she did not. And can, presumably, confirm, but when asked to, remained as a silent spectator for as far as I know, but she may have communicated something to them behind the scenes, as she was my other principle investigator, for whom I did a lot of programming, engineering, data generation and pipeline-optimizing, schematic-creating, and grant-idea-providing-and-writing work. When Chenliang told me he couldn't be my advisor, Niaz was the first person I asked. She said she couldn't, because she was in the Mechanical Engineering department. Niaz explicitly said nothing secure or concrete about funding, but that the process of transferring departments isn't easy enough to be my new advisor. I accepted that witout rebuttal, but, just to show the contrast between the professor and grad student, I had to work for her and the lab in the Mechanical Engineering department, concurrent with my studies in different specialized areas of AI in the CS department, not related to my research area in a direct way either, and I was forced by my advisor on that lab's project for my funding; reiterating that I contributed significantly to the grant funding both of them, with their names as authors and mine not. 

For all of the aforementioned reasons, and final, I was terminated without degree.
