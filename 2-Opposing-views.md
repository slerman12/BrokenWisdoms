## Part 1 

- **University-provided health insurance (Aetna)**
- **University-hospital doctor**
- **University-owned drug deliverer**

In the summer prior to my first year as a PhD student, my university-hospital doctor Lisa Beck prescribed a medication called Dupilumab. It's a biologic agent that you inject into your stomach that laser-targets a specific antibody associated with eczema. My eczema was severe and debilitating. Some time into taking the medication — I think maybe 8 months — my university-provided health insurance Aetna cut me off from the drug without warning. I wasn't notified by Aetna or my doctor, or the university-owned hospital, but by the university-owned intermediary deliverer, who was responsible for delivering the drug on a recurring basis to my doorstep, since it can't — or at least at the time couldn't — be provided for pick-up at a pharmacy. They called me and told me they couldn't reach my doctor, but for some reason Aetna had decided to no longer cover the prescription. I remember walking up and down Mt. Hope Avenue with my phone in a panic calling my doctor trying to reach her, and the university deliverer telling me they were trying to do the same and couldn't reach her either. After a while, my hair started falling out rapidly. I have no genetic predisposition to baldness, from any side of my family. The abnormally rapid hair loss was obviously due to the dependency and cessation. 

Though it fell out quickly, I didn't notice at first. The shower drains were filled with hair every day, and I thought it was maybe my housemate's girlfriend's. I didn't get to see my doctor until later in the Spring, a long time after, when I think much of the side and top of my head were bald. She diagnosed it as Alopecia Areata as a result of the sudden cessation of Dupilumab. To be clear, she diagnosed it as Alopecia Areata as a result of the sudden cessation of Dupilumab. She and her nurse took pictures and stored them in the university-hospital computers. 

Eventually, she sorted out things with the university-provided health insurance, but by then it was too late. Most of my hair had fallen out.

We finally got a delivery of the drug. I wasn’t sure whether it’d be safer at that point to re-instigate the dependency/addiction or avoid the drug at all costs.

Here's a personal story, since I was fixated with Taoism at the time:

To help me weigh the difficult decision — and it was difficult because that medication was extremely potent and didn't even help my eczema much, and I believed my hair would grow back — I asked the I Ching. Here I'll describe the hexagrams I got because I find it interesting that one of the predictions came true, and this might be medically useful since it corresponded thrice with my hair growing back (all three resurgences after the Alopecia Areata had developed into Alopecia Universalis, meaning after every piece of hair from my body had fallen out).

The I Ching "answered" it didn’t matter which of the two paths I chose ("The town may be changed, / But the well cannot be changed. / It neither decreases nor increases." - "The Well", unchanging). (Maybe an interesting observation: that the English "well" is phonetically similar to "wellness", as well). It also had previously "answered" my hair would grow back of its own accord, which it did, temporarily. I still remember: “Difficulty at the beginning” (as Richard Wilhelm described: “The name of the hexagram, Chun, really connotes a blade of grass pushing against an obstacle as it sprouts out of the earth — hence the meaning, 'Difficulty at the beginning'.”) $\rightarrow$ (changes to) “Fellowship with man” (e.g., baldness). That answer about whether my hair’d grow back came true with the steak-only diet (steak is "manly" and so that again ties to the hexagram symbolism of "Fellowship with man"), almost like a suggestion for how my hair could “sprout” out of the earth, my head, again… which it did, temporarily but covering my entire head except for an unnoticeable patch at the top of my scalp.

Then all the hair fell out again. Again, total baldness. No eyelashes, eyebrows, or hair.

Another time I did the steak-only diet, my pubic hair grew back — temporarily.

Another time I did the steak-only diet, a few eyelashes grew back for the first time. 

That can’t be a coincidence, so I leave this story here both for medical utility and for the understanding that [I now look like Gollum](https://www.facebook.com/photo/?fbid=10211230008185126&set=a.1273659620707) because of medical malpractice.

> By the way, the scariest nightmare I ever had, over and over that whole night, was the day I injected Dupilumab the first time. I remember my housemate at the time in the other room and I wanted to wake him. That's how scared I was. The nightmare was of a tall skinny slenderman, who kept approaching to rape me. Every time I closed my eyes and fell asleep, he'd reappear. Again and again, for that whole night. I never had a nightmare like that before. It was vivid.

<!-- <br><i><b>Note:</b> I finished making this diagram just as Pink Floyd's "Comfortably Numb" started playing on my Spotify, a song about a doctor taking a patient named "Pink"'s soul through "medicines" meant to help him. The next song was "Psycho Killer" which I'll interpret as psychiatric killer. Oh and then "Alabama  Song (Whisky Bar)." Not bad. Any song about alcohol is fitting for the topic of benzos, since they both work by GABA as the mechanism of action. In fact, I introduced a fellow hospital-inmate Lily to Elliott Smith for the first time with the song "Between the Bars" (about alcohol... not about Xanax bars [Xanax is another benzo and "bars" is the colloquially and sometimes clinically used term for pills of them]) while we were in the hospital (between the bars of confinement). Since she was keeping a synchronicity list while we were there, I think she'll appreciate these observations in this caption when I show her, though it would unfortunately be a non-sequitor to make any claims to their nature or significance. Some of these however are just linguistic.</i> -->

## Part 2

- **University-hospital psychiatrists**
- **University outpatient doctor**
- **University psychiatric ward janitor**
- **University-hospital police officers**

### Psychiatrists

This is going to be hard. What the fuck can I say? I was going to exclude this whole section. This is night-marish and you should be scared. Oh friendly psychiatrist pops in to tell me that they can't stop the benzodiazapine coercion. No, that's not the beginning...

Eczema leads to hair loss leads to depression and worsening psychiatric state. I get hospitalized. They force me to take benzodiazepines. I can barely recall those days because the dosage was so high... and I was \*so high\*. Benzos are potent medications that have alcohol-like effects and even an alcohol-like mechanism of action. So those days were a blur. But the thing with benzos is, the longer you take them, the more your brain downregulates. Because your brain knows they're poison, so your brain catches all the fancy GABA explosions and goes, "hmm, no something's wrong..." and its system-wide neurons stop producing GABA, the neurotransmitter that's 1/2 of the two primary chemical messengers in your brain.

Damn. I'm sorry. This is hard. 

Clinicians come in, telling me I have to keep taking the benzos. It's not my choice. In the hospital, it was either that or court order. The dose is huge, bigger than I'd ever taken. And I'm familiar with benzo dose calculations because I had a prescription before, for stress-induced eczema, and social anxiety. And I remember carefully tabulating when I could take one, but I only took them rarely, mostly for social events. I knew they were dangerous. I warily took a quarter to a half of a milligram before, less than once per every two weeks, if that much, and that much left hangover symptoms. Not major hangovers, not like alcohol, but noticeable, next-day drowsiness and my cognition feeling blurred. That was before the hospitalization, at a once-at-most-two-weeks rate. The hospital rate was beyond unprecedented for me, a 5'5" 110lb guy.

I had to stay there for a month and they forced me to take 48x that dosage reduced later to 12x that dosage, over the course of 3 times per day, every day. Think about that. $\frac{1}{4}$ to $\frac{1}{2}$ of a milligram, once every two weeks at most, had side effects. $48\text{x}$ $-$ $12\text{x}$ that dosage, but every day.

Accounting for dosage *and* rate, that’s a minimum $336\text{x}$ $-$ $84\text{x}$ &nbsp; to &nbsp; $672\text{x}$ $-$ $168\text{x}$ increase.

For the first three or so weeks, I was high. Then the fog rolled in. The chemical waterboarding was taking effect.

They said they'd wean me off before I was discharged, but changed their minds. Perhaps they saw how different the drugs made my personality and made the mistake of thinking they were treating the underlying root of something. There were two psychiatrists. The first one seemed to want to wean me off. The second one, I don't remember her name because I don't remember most names from that metaphorical airplane flight, was a tall Asian woman and she changed the first psychiatrist's decision last-minute and said the outpatient doctor would wean me off after the hospitalization, though they did gradually reduce the dose.

He didn't, and he was a bastard. I saw him for 6 months and don't remember his name either. But not because of being high. At that point, I was in severe cognitive decline. And the euphoria was turning into excruciating anxiety and fear, and then grey cloud and fog, and terror. I should've weaned myself off, but not only did the drug effect impair my cognition, but because of the terror-state I was in due to the drug, my self-confidence was too low to defy my doctor’s orders, even as every rational thought told me I should. I listened to him for 6 months, arguing as he kept vaguely prolonging a distant eventual taper date, for no justification specified other than falling back on clinical authority. I argued and I think that's most of what contributed to his doubling down.

3 months in, after reporting that I was brain damaged, he didn't believe me and wanted to increase the dose. I begged him to taper, and he thought if I was having all those negative symptoms, that the dose must've been too low.

I can't describe this.

This diagram is an original understanding of the  computational neuron with a differentiable analog implemented <a href="https://github.com/slerman12/UnifiedMLold2/tree/master/Blocks/Architectures/LermanBlocks/BioNeuron">here</a>. 

Here is a [video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1i5hS2iDVuo24PnGicvn5dIZYXUzDfPAl/view?usp=share_link) I made on the topic.

#

Let's begin a simplified explanation of the brain's neuron. Neurons are cells that are connected to one each other by dendrites and axons that pass chemical messengers from one neuron to downstream neurons. The two most common chemical messengers in the brain are the excitatory neurotransmitter Glutamate and the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA. Excitatory means they cause the next neuron to also release their neurotransmitters ("fire"). Inhibitory means they lower the voltage activity of the next neuron such that the next neuron is subdued. GABA is the mechanism of action of alcohol. People think alcohol is "disinhibitory", that it "disinhibits" them, but the reality is alcohol is actually inhibitory. It confuses GABA receptors into activating, causing an inhibition of that neuron and all the neurons in your brain. It's a system-wide drug that indiscriminately simulates GABA throughout every part of your brain, from the Occipital lobe, where your eyes see (in the back of your head), to the frontal lobe, where your brain thinks it thinks.

Benzos are GABA agonists, like alcohol. That means they simulate GABA or enhance GABA receptor function. But unlike the alcohol simulation evolved readily by the fermentation of fruit abundant in nature, benzos have not been integrated into the biological balancing mechanisms of the brain. They are more synthetic, and far more insidious, because they get around the brain's securities more, so much so that you might not even notice a headache the next day. Seems like a Godsend, a Panacea, but it's not. Because they are worse than alcohol. As a result of the influx of poison, the brain downregulates GABA production and receptor sensitivity universally across the brain, including Hippocampal memory, with no directly-evolved recovery response (see [here](https://youtu.be/TEKgesBVTJ0?si=OtXQYMZgVd3Qu36M) for a video I made on evolutionary algorithms in deep learning).

Nobody understands this mechanism. To understand this mechanism, you'd have to solve all of neurology and artificial intelligence, and psychiatrists definitely haven't. My diagram shows how GABA and GABA downregulation influence the brain. Benzos are a floodbath, and your brain responds to those GABA bursts by "downregulation": every neuron in the brain that is inhibited by GABA (that's almost every neuron in your brain) is directly affected. So doctors and psychiatrists, including the expert frontier researchers, not only don't understand the mechanisms of the entire brain, e.g. long-term memory, but feel equipped to coerce their interventions on every part, from the Amygdala to Hippocampal memory to the frontal cortex. Lack of GABA, as a result of GABA downregulation, then results in higher proportions of excitatory Glutamate than inhibitory GABA, a frequently observed result of which is epileptic seizures. It also leads to immense Hell, since GABA downregulation is anxiety itself. Think of the most anxious you've ever been in your life. Your brain was trying to lower/downregulate GABA levels compared to Glutamate in that moment to create that fear-response sensation. Having your brain's GABA downregulated is like living actively in a warzone. It is, without exaggeration, a form of legalized torture. Coerced benzo usage is neurochemical waterboarding. I mean that: we're not talking about some small theoretical evil. Former addicts of heroin or cocaine who withdrew from benzos have, in full sincerity, described the withdrawal (or to be more accurate, I would add downregulation) as being worse than heroin or cocaine. Not long ago, lobotomies and conversion therapies were standard practice. History will recognize the barbarism of today's psychiatric practices, especially around coercion, in particular of benzodiazepines. Scientific studies en masse, since 1980, showed that benzos cause long-term and sometimes permanent neurological damage, questionably contradicted but with almost none to support their long-term and daily-consumed efficacy.

1. By the way, I made these arguments to my outpatient doctor, and without any specific retort, he insisted on increasing the dosage. I sensed that literal healing came secondary to a psychological reaction in him to enforce his clinical authority rather than hear the truth or internalize the logic of the arguments.
2. While systemic issues don't excuse an individual clinician's disbelief in or coercion of a patient, the profits of big pharma companies in the $3 billion benzo drug market have added to the disarray of confusion in the practice and principle of clinicians, and I suspect studies.
3. I suspect the 6 months of inconsistent psychiatrist and doctor plans were due to the self-reinforcing biases clinicians (in the general sense) can create in themselves as they change a patient's personality through chemical interventions. My personality started very charming and cheerful due to the benzos, at which point they still planned to wean me off within the hospital. Then fear and anxiety rose due to increasing downregulation. As those induced neurological changes "doctored" my perception and psyche, my persuasiveness lessened and my presentation didn't have the emotional wealth that was perhaps expected for believability (due solely to my reduced neurological function, not any fundamental behavioral change), and each psychiatrist and changing shift of psychiatrists extended the asserted duration of the coerced prescription, changing the plans of themselves or of the previous psychiatrists, culminating with the outpatient doctor insisting on only increasing the dose, with no taper schedule on the foreseeable horizon. Doctors are aggressively playing Gods, and have no understanding of the severe bias that their own interventions produce in themselves, in their clinical decisions, and in their decision-making. Measurement-bias is a known analogous problem in science. Detection can result in a change in the state of the physical system (or organism or body) being detected. In medicine, this problem is less widely understood since the subjects being observed, detected, analyzed, judged, and changed are people.
4. This reminds me, that outpatient doctor commented on my bald head. He wouldn't believe me that the hair loss was induced. $\color{#d08370}\text{He}$ $\color{#d08370}\text{interrogated,}$ $\color{#d08370}\text{rather}$ $\color{#d08370}\text{repeatedly,}$ $\color{#d08370}\text{even}$ $\color{#d08370}\text{after}$ $\color{#d08370}\text{I}$ $\color{#d08370}\text{answered,}$ $\color{#d08370}\text{whether}$ $\color{#d08370}\text{I}$ $\color{#d08370}\text{had}$ $\color{#d08370}\text{pulled}$ $\color{#d08370}\text{the}$ $\color{#d08370}\text{hair}$ $\color{#d08370}\text{out}$ $\color{#d08370}\text{myself}$.

### Hospitalization

> My friend Lily (not her real name), who was a 24-year-old inpatient, had sex with the 50-something janitor of the psychiatric ward, in the psychiatric ward, while drugged by the university with benzos. Hudson, they electroshocked. Jeremiah, who's always been kind and never even the slightest dangerous, was pinned down violently and tackled on a driveway by the university-hospital police officers. Mobi, was a 16-year-old drug addict who they kept institutionalizing periodically and made take benzos for probably longer than me. 

Describing these events is really hard. I'm gonna try to do it in story form (at least for interpretability). I really want to do justice to the injustice, but in story form, it might not. The only way I can think to frame these events is around the context of someone I met in the hospital, Lily. She made the month there tolerable and enjoyable. Without her, like on other hospitalizations, like one where I was kept in the geriatric unit for elderly patients, the hospital environment and coercions would've been traumatic. And they were, before and after, for different reasons.

Lily was 24 when we met. While I was there, we played Guitar Hero with our friend Hudson and another guy. I got her to do yoga, since I was still doing all my yoga and meditation regimen while there and, later, meditation with me. Literally this is stream of consciousness, but: even when she was in coke withdrawal later in hospital-provided housing after our hospitalization, I got her to slow down from the tortured state and we meditated together. I even gave her a mantra, one I gleaned once somewhat illegitimately from the Transcendental Meditation (TM) list of Vedic mantras, perhaps a bad idea but the Vedic-sounding formalism got her to value the meditation session. No wait, it was one my mom used, I never did anything with the illegitimate ones except use the adjacent information to learn more about what the "advanced techniques" were about since I was skeptical. My mom and I got ours legitimately through the TM program. Mine has a coincidental meaning today but I'm not allowed to say what it is because in TM, mantras are usually kept personal but my mom already told me her's and doesn't meditate much and Lily needed it. Mantra meditations are scientifically backed by the way, not woo woo. Pop culturally they've gotten some credibility too. TM is the program the Beatles endorsed that the song "Across the Universe" is about. Not to mention plural millennia of Upanishad wisdom and the recent influx of analogous techniques in non-psychoactive therapeutic practice that teach analogous disciplines. Personally, I don't endorse anything because I don't want to be accountable for a stranger's (as opposed to friend's) bad experiences with a meditation that might have better studied alternatives with blame placeable elsewhere. Backtracking to the hospital again, I was also doing Pranayama as well, a breathing technique, and eating extremely healthy (my mom was even bringing in my Paleo-diet food as a substitute for the food the hospital had, that I shared with Lily as well since she really liked that food, and probably would've been glad to eat a diet like that if the hospital had any real substitute for the processed garbage they served out, itself a drug). I really did not need to be inoculated against my will with floodbaths of benzos for the next >6 months. [TO DO: Edit this paragraph. I only include it to make the point that my health practices were far too healthy for psychiatrists to be dictating what potent psychoactive drugs go into my body. If anything, I should have been dictating their practices.]

In the hospital-provided housing that she had when I came to visit, her neighbor made food, a huge meal, pork chops and mashed potatoes and surprisingly all really good food. We then ate a Thanksgiving dinner with her neighbor. I brought yams I'd made previously before the invitation, not knowing I was going to be visiting/staying there for Thanksgiving. 

She told me at that hangout she had sex with the 50-something year old psychiatric ward janitor while hospitalized. I think she said he was her most recent boyfriend, that they got into a relationship afterwards that lasted some time, and she'd broken up with him. They probably have text conversations to confirm.

> [!WARNING] 
> Idea: This is so radical I shouldn't write it. Forms of physical touch and intimacy therapy as treatments for depression, anxiety, PTSD, and [touch starvation](https://youtu.be/4zJXr4jeP5w?si=bQCCeK4_Cxv1MbL1) would be better alternatives for patients than janitors. The University of Rochester as a research institution is capable of investigating whether bonding, romance, and physical human touch therapies can have efficacy for issues like depression, anxiety, PTSD, and touch starvation. It would be — let’s go with "at least marginally" — better than janitors. The institution's first instinct, on hearing or reading this, might be to subdue patients further, taking away even more of their paths to spiritual integration, or just to fire a janitor. Subduing patients further isn't an answer. That oppression was also the institution’s direct role in the consensual decisions between Lily and the janitor of that psychiatric ward, for reasons including: (1) she potentially was being involuntarily held there, (2) the architectural and design oppressiveness of those environments, and, especially, (3) since she was being drugged with personality-disinhibiting benzos directly by the institution (that is an institutionally inflicted date-rape, consensual or not). "Medicine" doesn't solve the problem. Reducing coercion and designing centers where healing can happen are crucial steps. Intimacy healing is needed in the real world, and there's no shortcut alternative. The concurrent answer is to bring those experiences into the real world, without drugs, through both medicine (intimacy healing) and sex work (fine art); the two can overlap; communications is a subset of intimacy healing that also needs greater exploration.

While she and I were in the hospital, backtracking again, our third companion was Hudson. When I was being discharged, he wrote me this long letter that included the line, "I hope you remember me when your an Icon of the world." He was electroshocked weekly during my stay there. For depression. Electrovolts of lightning in an electric chair for his depression. 

<p align="center">
<img width="300" alt="Screenshot 2024-03-12 at 8 10 34 PM" src="https://github.com/slerman12/Detective-Sam/assets/9126603/d5414cba-2012-42f9-b516-f06dd8760cad">
</p>

It's amazing he could write at all after the electrocution they put him through. I guess pharmaceuticals didn't seem sufficiently crucial to the core of his depression that they believed hooking him up to a car battery would make more sense.

Meanwhile, little did I know — and actually quite a lot since I made the case quite articulately — I was being brain damaged and chemically waterboarded.

My friend Jeremiah, someone so kind it's not even funny, went through something different while he was there. He told me the university-hospital police officers held him down and choked him for trying to escape, tackled and pinned him down violently on pavement, and that his medications once caused him to have a seizure. Having undergone physical assaults from the university-hospital police myself, due also to efforts to leave containment, and once in the grass outside, and burned alive in the downregulation nightmare, I can say it’s unpleasant. 

Those events are listed in the reverse chronological order by the way, combative efforts to escape only appearing in later hospitalizations that followed the multi-year benzo nightmare.

Finally, Mobi, this guy I met there at a different hospitalization. He actually braided Lily's hair, I later found out. When you have people in there with you, it's actually palatable. But when you're alone, kept hostage, for prolonged periods, against your will, under constant overwatch and coercion, it's not the same story. Mobi was 16, also prescribed benzos like I was, but he was there much longer. Years, in and out. This is the part I can't even believe as I write: he was in there for drug problems and addiction. No wonder: they were feeding him the most potent addictive chemicals on the known planet by force. Yes: to be clear: they'd been giving him benzos for 2 years at that point, on and off perhaps, from the age of 14. Acclimating to benzos, yes, your brain is going to feel deprived of GABA and you will want drugs.

And he was intelligent and respectful and well mannered. There is no way he should've been in the hospital. He could've been a revolution leader or some shit.

The next part of the story conveys some of my trauma, and it's the hardest to write about. I might not... Hold on...

Dear God, if you can let me describe this in a way that does me justice... [Michael L. Scott pops from the window and shoots me in the head]

I was in severe agony three months in, the doctor refused to help with the taper, he came to the conclusion that we should increase the dose. I was already in severe agony. I had to keep taking them, then I was in severely worse agony six months in. I, this whole time, was in pain, which I this whole time communicated to that doctor, that my cognition was worsening each month to levels I never experienced it, and my anxiety was like torture and unlike any I felt before, I wasn't able to recall sentimental memories, or do basic math. My brain was grey, I was brain damaged, the plausibility of permanent brain damage was high, I had to wean off. I know it's good that I gradually reduced the dose because at that point, you might not agree with calling it brain damage, but it literally was, and if I'm speaking most-accurately, it was active chemical waterboarding. Then the agony persisted for more than a year after, indescribable, severe and debilitating (still chemical waterboarding, but I guess you could say "residual" or inactive). 

[I proceed to depict unbelievably what I went through]

Laying on the couch for a year, immobilized, shaking with excruciating agony. No sleep, no escape. No exit, just PhD work and torture. Skin dry, teeth calcifying (at a dental cleaning appointment, the hygienist diagnosed it as calcification and the attributed cause as dry mouth due to benzodiazepines), no memory, no linguistic expression, cognition completely grey and burning. All color gone, all imagery, all imagination, only pain, perpetual pain and fear. Terror. Terror terror terror. I wasn't able to do 4*7. They say the only thing to fear is fear itself: GABA downregulation is fear itself. The experience is like being in a warzone. It's like burning alive — without stop — more than a year, torture. The neurochemical experience is literally what you go through if you're in a warzone, and being chased by a predator, while in the middle of having a seizure: hellfire, indescribable pain. I remember staying up nights shaking, trying CBD oil or L-theanine (common amino acid found in tea leaves) to try to sleep and just shaking, electricity swarming through me, my face curled, describable as tense and agonized all night unless I got some sleep if I was lucky and then waking up feeling like that, again, for the rest of the day (these symptoms started around the 4 or 5 month mark while I was still on the benzos). I've read former cocaine and heroin addicts say the withdrawal of long-term benzo addiction is worse than for cocaine or heroin. I'm sure there isn't an experience on this Earth that is worse, humanly or cosmically possible (a year without sleep, non-stop neurochemical fire, not sure that's even imaginable).

The nightmare I mentioned earlier was a waking one for a year.

You know, the way I learned about the calcification was because chunks of what I thought were tooth were falling out. Just chunks of tooth-like pieces from my mouth. So I went to the dental hygienist and she said it was de-calcification. For some reason my teeth had calcified during the time I was on the benzos. She diagnosed it, by whatever authority she has, as that. This was already when I was starting to recover to some extent about 10 months after withdrawing, when I was already on the steak-only diet. To reiterate: it started *de*-calcifying at that point. The calcification built up a lot during the 6 months I was on benzos.

The steak-diet saved my ass.

That Hell from the GABA downregulation didn't go away for more than a year, though the linguistics seem to want to say "for a full year" everytime I type this, even though more than a year and possibly ongoing is more accurate. Every neuron in my brain was behaving as if I was being mauled by a bear, without pause, day and night, every minute.

And yep to mention the paranoia and distrust built into me from undergoing psychiatrist coercion, repeatedly being told I was going to be weaned off by the psychiatrists soon then relatively soon then at least eventually, and with the psychiatrist attempts to reassure me ultimately having proved to be straight-up lies, unjustified by any argument, all of my predictions still holding true and evidenced by the outcome and all of the psychiatrist self-contradicting plans causing the Hell on me that I warned them (the psychiatrists) of.

Did I mention these were University of Rochester *psychiatrists*? Okay good, just making sure the subject is still clear. The referent object, me, not having done anything to deserve this, in case that's in doubt, and all of this being inflicted by the same institution.

The experience of losing my hair has cost me relationships and worsened my social anxiety, and the benzo-brain damage and torture leaves me with PTSD.

Many Jews, including my grandpa, his sister, and his mom (his father was mandatorily fighting in the warfront), fled the Nazis to Muslim nations, like Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan for refuge. My grandpa's family evacuated from Ukraine to Kazakhstan. After the temporary evacuation, he returned to Ukraine, where he met my grandma, they married, and he was later assigned to a job in Samarkand, Uzbekistan by the Soviet Union to work at a leather plant/factory producing leather from sheepskin fur. He was a leather technology engineer there. Samarkand is where my mom and eventually my sister and I were born. My mom and her brother were born and grew up in Samarkand and lived there past the ages of 40 until we all immigrated, on separate occasions since my mom had to do a separate interview with the American Embassy in Moscow to convince them. One proof of subjugation she had is that, by custom, Jews weren’t allowed into PhD programs in Uzbekistan. She had a Master’s degree in music theory, was a great student, and taught at a music college, but wasn’t allowed to do a PhD for that reason. Jews weren’t customarily allowed to hold higher offices in Uzbekistan, generally. When she did the interview, she brought her two kids, my sister and I, to Moscow. I was 3 years old. My Aunt’s brother’s family in Moscow let her hold us at their house while my mom waited at the Embassy, all day, without food, and went through the interview. The interviewer remarked that her form said she had kids and was surprised she didn’t bring them. She spent the full day in that embassy, waiting, without food. “How could I bring them?" she said. "My son is 3 years old. Keep a baby here without food all day?” And the interviewer laughed and answered with appreciation, “No, you’re absolutely right. Usually moms bring their kids here in order to show them to us to gain belief or sympathy. They think by proving they have kids, they will get accepted.”

In America, my mom found a low-paying piano teaching job, and got a second degree at a community college in Computer Information Systems to earn more money, since she had to support us and my grandparents by herself. She actually taught me how to program — specifically, object-oriented programming — when I started my undergrad at the University of Rochester. I couldn’t understand a thing my Introduction to Computer Science professor, Prof. Pawlicki, was teaching. I remember I did all of the extra credit for his first project (the first Computer Science project I ever had), but he found one comment with explanatory concepts in the code still left in there that I didn’t bother to remove since I didn’t cheat or copy any code. He failed me on that project and gave me a -100% for leaving in that comment (cheating), and when I emailed him, he doubled down in a long conversation that it was academic dishonesty. Ironically, in the real world, that comment would’ve likely been legal for commercial use, and in a court, would be defendable as free speech probably under the first amendment. He didn’t appreciate free speech as much as he later might've. You see, later he made an offhand comment in a student Facebook group telling the student body to go to Canada if they didn't support Trump, and got [a lot of flack for that offhand comment](https://www.rochesterfirst.com/news/local-news/u-of-r-professor-steps-down-as-program-director-after-controversial-facebook-post/). Also, full disclosure regarding the explanatory comment in my code: my mom left that comment in, because she was helping me. She helped me with all of the projects and labs in that class, and I transitively helped my friend who was in that class with me as well. Though my mom and I didn't move to Canada afterwards, I did get into the doctoral program at the University of Rochester thanks to her.

Well, thanks to her and my doctoral advisor, Henry.

Prior to that, after my family moved to the United States as Jewish refugees from the Republic of Uzbekistan when I was four, I faced many challenges: assimilating to American culture, learning English, living in a small apartment with a single mother, poverty, and processing the loss of my grandparents. On one hand, I understand the burden of poverty and the struggle of being an immigrant. Academically, this means being passionate and dedicated; socially, being open minded towards people of different backgrounds. On the other hand, however, I consider myself to be privileged. My mother is the embodiment of compassion. Material wealth is worthless without meaningful relationships, and disadvantaged conditions are made rich with love. 

My mother raised me to understand the importance of looking at the world from another's perspective. As one cannot understand others without first understanding oneself, I have always sought to explore my mind. To me, artificial intelligence is an extension of the rigorous self-analysis I've been doing my entire life. Designing an intelligent machine not only requires an understanding of mathematics and computer science, but also of humanity and of motivation — and this understanding is afforded to me by the empathy I have for others and by the exploration of my consciousness. Not only can I connect the study of intelligence to my lifelong curiosity around the mystery of life, but I can realize these great technologies to affect the world in profoundly positive and meaningful ways. My aspiration in my career was to solve general intelligence, and have a voice in ensuring that it is used in the interest of every living thing.	
 
I joined the Center for Health and Technology a year into their efforts to model Parkinson’s disease (PD) progression. It was an honor to be entrusted with leading the PPMI Data Challenge project, a high-profile data contest hosted by the Michael J. Fox Foundation, which asked, "What factors at baseline predict clinical progression?"

Charles was my first advisor there.

Henry recommended me to the position at the Med Center to do disease modeling, while I was still an undergrad, predating all of the medical trauma, specifically, and entirely by coincidence, doing research in neurodegenerative disease modeling. “Neurodegenerative” means when the brain degenerates, for example, by chemical floodbaths of GABA and severe downregulation.

The work I did at the Med Center earned me a recommendation back to Henry Kautz. On top of that, I built [a sleek website API for Twitter GNIP data mining](https://github.com/slerman12/TwitterDataCollector) for Henry's research group, and was praised by other affiliates of his that he recommended me to, at [Bryx emergency response](https://bryx.com). As a result, he accepted me into his group as a doctoral student.

While I was working and researching under Charles, I had built a [disease prognostication machine learning model](https://github.com/slerman12/DiseaseModeling) that won top-three in the Michael J. Fox Foundation for Parkinson's Research PPMI  contest, and came up with the idea of building a web app for the prognostication to give clinicians a clean, elegant interface. I had to argue a bit, and convince them, and then they let me, and, as a PhD student (about in my second year, already in benzo withdrawal), I even presented it at a conference in DC in front of reknowned researchers in the Parkinson's research field. Despite that being my idea and my [prototype](https://github.com/slerman12/DiseaseModelingWebApp), they liked it so much that they hired a web development team to build one, and since have never given me credit. They also patented it, and since have given me no proprietary rights or earnings either.

Perhaps Charles or some of his colleagues may find the [above diagram](#benzodiazepine-mechanism-of-action) valuable in their work, this time ideally with credit attribution.

Henry told me I passed my area exam in my second PhD year with "flying colors." I haven't gotten to the fact that before my hospitalization, I was extremely ahead of every curve already, not the mentioned research. The hospitalization coincided with when I’d innovated independently on MHDPA, the method underlying ChatGPT, 6 years ago, with fully implemented and novel code in hand (from scratch, since that was still Tensorflow 1.0 days and no one was using Pytorch), and wrote a [paper](https://www.overleaf.com/read/qgmmzgsrctmg#6cd1b9), just before and in the hospital, finishing the final — successful — experiments for that paper from the hospital because they allowed my mom to bring in my laptop after some insistence. I was the only one at the time in the entire University of Rochester, PhD students included, who heard of [MHDPA](https://github.com/slerman12/BrokenWisdoms/blob/Ancillary/Conv-is-all-you-need.md). It’s funny, knowing them, they might forget, but, yes, in 2018, I was the only student or faculty who heard of [MHDPA](https://github.com/slerman12/BrokenWisdoms/blob/Ancillary/Conv-is-all-you-need.md), seeing as almost nobody outside of DeepMind heard of [MHDPA](https://github.com/slerman12/BrokenWisdoms/blob/Ancillary/Conv-is-all-you-need.md) then. 

And I showed "Lily" the MHDPA paper in the hospital. She said she could read it. It was unusually readable. She liked it and told me about her mom's writing in a published short story collection with Stephen King. Her mom later reviewed a creative work I wrote (and with "Lily"'s permission, will probably review this — note, I'm still writing fucknuts).

After the hospitalization, it was from that couch during a video call with my advisor (who was in DC) during the peak-period of the withdrawal  that I described that biologically-inspired neuron architecture [above](#benzodiazepine-mechanism-of-action), with the specifics in the [video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1i5hS2iDVuo24PnGicvn5dIZYXUzDfPAl/view?usp=share_link) comparing it to the LSTM architecture.

I remember having video calls from my office with him too, teaching him "sequence-to-sequence attention," and being in a state of misery that I couldn't convey to him believably. And the believability amid that benzo-brain damage is again an issue because he pretty much just directed me to see a therapist, or maybe Prozac or some other SSRI would help since it helped his son I think he said. 

Besides that, I co-TA’d philosophy of consciousness with my friend, and got straight As in my grad-level classes. The semester ended around the 4 month-benzo mark, just at that precipice of brain damage.

I also passed my [area exam](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1LK0urIs8yu_e7HyZ-VQoDJUiGpPeTPEUgfhjK5Kw_7w/edit?usp=sharing) with flying colors shortly after that semester, mid-brain damage, and the whole room felt it because I was high off of my fucking balls and presenting genius ideas simpler than they'd ever heard them, not that, in the case of ideas around MHDPA or long-term episodic memory or any other brilliant foresight at the time, they ever heard them.

That was the only time in my life I ever took a high dose of benzos on purpose, and it was during the severe withdrawal, not by choice — though, given that I still had to present in front of the fuck-morons — on purpose. And rightfully, justifiably, unlike every doctor who ever coerced them on me. So yes, that might explain the "flying colors" even more than my advisor (who I would not call a fuck-moron) realized when he looked me proudly in the eye and told me that I passed with flying colors. Because, let me reiterate: I did.

Also, I rehearsed that area exam in front of my mom and uncle for a week every day before the area exam.

At the area exam, I presented word by word as I rehearsed but with "personality colors" added due to confidence. My mom and uncle knew I was going to take a specific dose of benzos that day. That was the plan. I even rehearsed one day in front of them at a smaller dose. They also knew. That was also the plan. And, when I presented in front of the professors with confidence, they all swooned like idiots because confidence is all that determined the judgements of these top-of-the-crop professors, since they literally are too dumb to appreciate any good ideas unless colorfully presented, and usually only appreciate bad ideas, and when extremely tediously/convolutedly presented. That's usually how it goes. These are the same people who *argued* — many of whom anyway — that deep learning was a fad. None of whom heard of MHDPA. Henry tentatively disagreed with my MHDPA reearch. None of them had creative or original ideas by my judgement of their work over their entire careers, and I'm sorry.

My advisor, Henry, didn't think deep learning was a fad, and had a sense of intuition about ideas like the biologically-inspired neuron in the diagram [above](#benzodiazepine-mechanism-of-action) though not always of involved ideas, like the use of attention mechanisms (e.g., MHDPA). My next advisor, my machine vision professor from my first year Chenliang Xu, technically wasn't in the room, because he was answering the Skype call from China. He's the only person in the meeting who asked elaboration on how I planned to do "relational representations" for vision with image features from a CNN, since he didn't know what MHDPA was (neither did my NLP professor, who also did and oversaw work in deep learning, from the semester just before my hospitalization) and I went back to the MHDPA slides and re-described MHDPA to all of them again, and the fact that he was the only one of them who showed interest in the most crucial part of the oncoming years of their fields, and not only my confidence, is meaningful since he became my later advisor.  

Henry got an offer to lead the AI division at the National Science Foundation, which is an extremely prestigious role. So he accepted and I had to find a new advisor. He directed me to switch to Chenliang Xu, who gave me an ultimatum about joining.

Meanwhile I was working at the Med Center, so I secured my funding through that.

### Chenliang Xu

Concurrent with this, while I was still in withdrawal from the benzodiazepines and in the Spring semester of my third year in the PhD program, I was forced to switch from being Henry Kautz's student because Henry got a prestigious position offer to direct at the NSF that he accepted. In defense of Henry, he'd already done a lot for me, and had no formal background or experience with deep learning to facilitate my research studies compared to, who he recommended, Chenliang Xu, whose lab I had to then fight to get into, with an ultimatum pressed on me to write a top-venue Computer Vision paper, from scratch, by the end of that summer for him or be rejected advisor-less from the PhD program. 

Computer Vision wasn't my field, so I had to transfer over the little relevant material from the Med Center to an entirely different branch of AI, and write a top-venue paper for that. That seemed like an unecessary ultimatum, since I presented what became Vision Transformers to him in his office on his whiteboard for Semantic Image Segmentation, and he neither liked or disapproved of the idea, but the work that would've been involved — to do that by the end of the Summer from scratch in a new field, in Computer Vision — would've been impossible. The MHDPA paper I wrote was in NLP (natural language processing, so transferring that over to a top-venue paper would've been a gamble and require me inventing Vision Transformers, running all the experiments, etc. in a month).

Because I was on the steak-only diet and working from dawn to night, I was able to do it.

However, I had to work at the Med Center concurrently for funding, since Chenliang wasn't paying me, and had to spend months giving my nights and weekends to achieving this, while still reporting to him and his lab every week, with beautiful clean presentations, and diagrams with as much care put into them as the bio-neuron [above](#benzodiazepine-mechanism-of-action) (that, at the time, wouldn't have been easy to implement for Computer Vision, and, to be clear, the field of Computer Vision conventionally required state of the art results on some existing baseline metric like ImageNet for a top-venue paper, which the bio-neuron probably wouldn't have done).

In defense of Chenliang: he eventually accepted me into his lab (when I succesfully delivered that [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.08601)), and stayed uneventfully nice throughout the time, while not expressing judgement towards my social anxiety. He sometimes had a good understanding of AI, better than others at the university. His spirit, sometimes, felt extraordinarily supportive. He contradictorily wanted efficiency with somewhat respecting my slower publication pace while I built UnifiedML, and I believed he fully knew that I was intelligent enough to warrant investing faith in. While 2 publications in 3 years is (I think) less than his average student, that was, however, his only reason for terminating me when I was in my 6th year, three years later, an average number of publications.

For context, Henry's average was 1 - 3 across the PhD student's full tenure.

There were further terrors at the University of Rochester Medical Center that I don't want to get into under Chenliang's tenure (one of the easier ones to point out, that happened in the geriatric unit one, was my big toe getting running over by the wheelchair I was in as the nurse pushed it, me screaming in pain, and with the nurse rolling me off and other nurses all ignoring). 

### Niaz Abdolrahim

I was transferred to the Mechanical Engineering department. It was there, while working under Chenliang (who symbollically led the deep learning side of the work, with me leading the deep learning side of the work) and Niaz (who was a great PI) that Chenliang informed me I didn't have enough papers, while in the middle of paper-review for a paper with really positive reviews, and he would be deserting as my advisor.

I asked if Niaz could be my advisor, and she said transfering to the Mechanical Engineering department — formally — is hard and that it was unlikely.

The paper ended up getting acepted, after my termination and on the day before my last day as an employed student.

Chenliang put me on the Mechanical Engineering lab as the source of my funding, on a project which I led, which was funded by two pretty-major grants that I helped write, which included my ideas, which somehow, by Chenliang's and very-much-not-Niaz's decision, wouldn't fund me any longer.

Niaz, perhaps an "opposing view," though someone I really like, was my other Principle Investigator next to Chenliang. Oh but to be clear, I was still in Chenliang's lab and reporting to that lab as well every week. I was doing extreme amounts of work for both. 

For Niaz's group whose group, I did a lot of programming, serving in a software engineering-type role despite having gotten some strong credibility as understanding more than that; data generation and pipeline-optimizing; schematic-creating; and grant-idea-providing-and-writing work. 

In Chenliang's group, I was still trying to do my own research, which was pretty heavily bottlenecked. That's part of why I stayed up days and nights then, too, practicing every discipline imaginable — from Transcendental Meditation to yoga to freezing cold ice baths — to achieve the [full scope](https://github.com/AGI-init/UnifiedML-legacy) of what I wanted to do for [both](https://github.com/AGI-init/XRDs).

When Chenliang told me he couldn't be my advisor, I asked Niaz if she could be. She said she couldn't, because she was in the Mechanical Engineering department and that the process of transferring departments isn't easy enough to be my new advisor, and that maybe she could reach out to the Dean, since she sympathized sincerely with my concerns. She also advised that I reach out to the CARE Network, something I at first took some mild offense to, because I'd relayed to her the medical institution trauma with specifics, and she clarified, no, she meant reaching out to them for a lawyer. I appreciated that.  I'm grateful Chenliang forced me on that project because of Niaz. But I did a lot for them in the Mechanical Engineering department, concurrent with my studies in AI separately in his lab, and I had no choice because that project's grants, that I helped write, was the source of my funding, with their names as authors and me uncredited. As mentioned, I did a lot of engineering and data work for them that was independent to my research, that ordinarily would get paid a 6-figure salary for, while I have never been paid more than $15/hr in my life, and the termination left me with tons of student debt.

So you see, because my family was poor, my student debt (for the University of Rochester) was subsidized for as long as I was a student. So when I was terminated, my student debt started accumulating, and I had to pay the large sum of money. Dang, how ever will I pay them back?

Makes me want to go #NotEnoughPapers.

However, that lab is the least of the work I did ([here](https://github.com/slerman12/BrokenWisdoms/blob/main/5-Early-work-in-program.md)/[here](https://github.com/slerman12/BrokenWisdoms/blob/main/6-Indebted.md)/[here](https://github.com/AGI-init/UnifiedML-legacy)/[here](https://github.com/AGI-init/XRDs)/[here](https://github.com/slerman12/Builder)/[here](https://github.com/AGI-init/Tributaries)/[here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ZQFeiOKSU2teVGg5EHlgREAi8pJY_Mr1CJ3H2pfFBfI/edit?usp=sharing)).

They Holocausted me.

They Holocausted me. By whatever legal definition exists, they Holocausted me. Every lawyer agrees, that by whatever legal definition exists, they Holocausted me.

Now rewind in time a bit. Not to the days of the Canaanites, but to the days before Chris Kanan.

Two of my advisors and two of my committee members deserted, for funsies, e.g. sabbaticals (I barely had time for Sabbath), promotions, etc., and I was left with a brand new interim committee, consisting of Chenliang Xu, who had just announced his desertion, Charles Venuto, who worked in the Med Center and had no expertise in AI, Chris Kanan, last-minute added interim committee member, and Tom Howard, last-minute added interim committee member.

I never effectively met half of my committee, we had one 20-minute Zoom call in which I presented, and then an after-room discussion.

In defense of the committee members who agreed on the decision, most of them didn't know me and hadn't met each other or me previously, and one of them, in a kind of *deus ex machina* (or so I thought, since that should have conclusively settled it), [mis-remembered](https://github.com/slerman12/BrokenWisdoms/blob/Ancillary/Deus-Ex-Memory.md) the short Zoom meeting that the four of us had (I highly recommend clicking on that link), on which these decisions from their end were based, as being 1.5 hours and twice. That is quite a lapse in memory (Chris Kanan is the youngest of the bunch). The meeting was 30 minutes, and once, as the other committee members may recall and confirm. The calendar invitation that that committee member, Chris Kanan, accepted, wrote: "Friday May 5, 2023 ⋅ 1pm – 1:45pm (Eastern Time - New York)" (extra lag time added). I have on email to one committee member Tom Howard that we planned half an hour: "Would you be available any of the following dates for a half-hour remote 6-month review?" It can be confirmed that it was 30 minutes in which I had to summarize 6 years of work over Zoom: 20ish minutes spent on my presentation, then 5ish minutes (it felt like longer) for their independent-room discussion and 5 minutes for concluding remarks. 

I should add details about the work that Chris Kanan asked me to do, or suggested rather, that I followed through on. Maybe in this [chapter](https://github.com/slerman12/BrokenWisdoms/blob/main/3-Disproof.md) and [this one](https://github.com/slerman12/BrokenWisdoms/blob/main/6-Indebted.md), but see terminator-bubble-diagram immediately above and I'll summarize below.

Long-term memory is what I was working on longest. From the Spring semester of my Freshman year, 
- when I built a long-term episodic memory reinforcement learning controller using image features from Felzenshwalb segmentation in Chenliang Xu's machine vision class,
- to that semester where I actually did meet Tom Howard for 5 minutes and told him about using the idea for robotics when we went to his robotics lab because he took an interest (and that short exchange is the only time I talked to him prior to this),
- to plenty of email-record (e.g. with Prof. Len Schubert),
- as well as my area exam,
- as well as my thesis proposal,
- as well as what I was doing at the Med Center that Charles Venuto has email evidence of as well,
- up to even this meeting with the new committee, where I showed [all of what I had done on that (lifelong, adaptive, rewritable, growing, accelerated Replay Memory for use in RL or supervision or generative modeling) and more](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ZQFeiOKSU2teVGg5EHlgREAi8pJY_Mr1CJ3H2pfFBfI/edit?usp=sharing).

Coincidentally, they all had evidence that this is something I was trying to do through my full PhD, and *for some reason* — I'll let you guess why — maybe didn't do as much on long-term episodic memory as I wanted. But nobody wanted me to. Everybody wanted me to pursue their different independent area research. Except Chris Kanan. Who suggested, wisely, after that 20-minute Zoom meeting, by email one month after I delivered a big new research proposal as they insanely requested, that I develop a brand new reinforcement learning systems algorithm for my giant built-from-scratch deep learning framework [UnifiedML](https://github.com/slerman12/Builder), and I did within two months ([here is one of the commits](https://github.com/slerman12/Builder/commit/e8b896c75bdeb388995af912a25108dfa16a92f9) when I finished implementing [it](https://github.com/AGI-init/UnifiedML/blob/ef14f7ff14b0b494d14bc8ee4bfe8925ad2a1fb3/ML/World/Replay.py#L566-L607), *sampling without replacement* within a priority, accelerated, parallelized, memory-mappable Replay Memory using truly-shared RAM memory, dynamically growable and rewritable and unified with supervised and generative modeling, innovating on the state of the art reinforcement learning algorithm/system DRQV2), the day before the meeting with Chenliang, when I told him about my algorithm/system — and it actually is brilliant — and he liked it dismissively, then proceeded to tell me he couldn't be my advisor because I didn't have enough papers. It was a good meeting, but he didn't know what he was doing.

### Tom Howard

</p>

The independent-room discussion reasonably marked the end of my portion of the meeting, or so I thought. However, after the independent-room discussion, we kept talking, I left, and Chenliang later told me that the committee members thought I dropped the line early. That was a misunderstanding. I really thought the meeting was over since they conveyed everything I had to do next, or at least that they were going to in that discussion. At the very, very end of the discussion, one of the committee members, Tom Howard, said, “I just want to add, I think it’s important.” I actually in my sleep deprivation thought he meant my work (I suspect he probably meant the chapter-list), so I did a sincere and prolonged “bless you” sign with my hands in the silence and left. I know that this is the least believable part. Chenliang knew I hadn’t slept that whole night, due to insomnia and maybe-nervousness, and I mentioned that "I didn't sleep all night" during the meeting to which I think Tom Howard off-handedly, maybe-non-noticedly said "I know," before resuming his point. 

Chenliang had to take his dog to the vet, for that matter. Either his wife did or him, but the meeting had to be no more than half an hour by what he told me. How we scheduled, over Slack. 
- If I left early, it’s further justified by what Chenliang wrote to me on Slack, about needing to take his dog to the vet immediately after the meeting, assumed 30 minutes, his wife possibly being able to do it, or otherwise having to reschedule the vet to later in the day, which probably can be verified with either his vet or his wife or just his calender.

He (Tom Howard) concluded the meeting saying “I just want to add, I think it’s important” in reference to the chapter-list, and I did a "bless you" sign with my hands, as I'd previous felt the need to do after a robotics-related pitch to Chenliang's group coincidentally, in-person in Chenliang's lab, and robotics is Tom Howard's field. That was a coincidence though. It was just a vivid moment in Chenliang's lab, with all of his students there as witness, when he agreed to buy me one of the $300 Bittle robots that I could use with the robotics software that I was building, that I did a "bless you" sign for in gratitude. I meant it in a similar way to Tom Howard, but I interpreted “I just want to add, I think it’s important” as being in reference to my research, not the chapter-list.

The chapter-list was the only requirement they wanted to make in that meeting. We had the entire after-independent-room discussion and they didn't specify anything other than the chapter-list. I'm sure they weren't going to. Perhaps one of them can even confirm that nothing more than the chapter-list was discussed as extra requirement in their independent-room meeting. That was clear from context.

But afterwards, I got an email — I think from Chenliang and perhaps from the graduate coordinator — specifying two altogether different requirements, with only an auxiliary mention of the chapter-list. Here they were, as apparently decided by the committee (post-hoc) after their chapter-list decision in the actual six-month review:

> ### $"$
> As remediation, the committee asks the student to
>
> 1. ﻿﻿before June 5, 2023, provide a 1-page write up that addresses the problem statement, hypothesis, and approaches of the thesis and give an outline of thesis chapters,
> 2. ﻿﻿﻿before August 30, 2023, re-do and pass a six-month review.
> ### $``$

It's ironic that I'm being asked for remediation.

I don't know who decided these extra requirements, if it was the CS chair Michael Scott, or Tom Howard, or Chris Kanan, or even Chenliang.

I delivered a 6-page write up, as well as a chapter-list, as well as a 1-page write up summary in the 6-page write up, meeting all the requirements of (1) for this brand new interim committee that effectively never met me. 

Subsequently, Chris Kanan suggested that I innovate a new reinforcement learning systems-based algorithm, which I did, as I described [above](#chris-kanan).

These are enormous requirements that I met on their behalf.

The actual six-month review was **May 5th, 2023**. Then Chenliang notified me of his desertion on **July 24th, 2023**, a day after I finished implementing the [novel reinforcement learning systems-based algorithm](https://github.com/AGI-init/UnifiedML/blob/ef14f7ff14b0b494d14bc8ee4bfe8925ad2a1fb3/ML/World/Replay.py#L566-L607) (and [here](https://github.com/slerman12/Builder/commit/e8b896c75bdeb388995af912a25108dfa16a92f9) is the specific commit), and Chenliang confirmed the desertion by email for the rest of the committee and Michael Scott on **August 10th, 2024**, prior to the **August 30, 2023** date of requirement (2).

First, some elaboration on Charles since he was on my committee:

Charles was my Med Center advisor. Charles and Henry both oversaw me in those first 3 years, before Henry's promotion meant I had to switch into Chenliang's lab and start an altogether new Computer Vision-branch focus of research, with an ultimatum to submit a top-venue paper that summer *in* Computer Vision, literally a brand new field to me. And I did. Amazingly. Though that seems to be unappreciated (the benchmarks and conventions for actual acceptance, though not necessarily substance, are more elaborate than just plopping MHDPA on top of a CNN). However, the explainability-centric paper that I came up with, derived, wrote, and programmed would not have been my preferred research area, since I was working on MHDPA and long-term episodic memory methods for Charles in the Med Center (and Henry) prior to that, and wrote [my novel MHDPA method paper](https://www.overleaf.com/read/qgmmzgsrctmg#6cd1b9) before MHDPA had any popularity or reknown outside of small groups at DeepMind. MHDPA, for the uninitiated, became the backbone, 5 years later, of foundation models like ChatGPT. Henry doubted my obsession with the method back in 2018. No one at the university heard of it. And when switching to Chenliang's lab, he wasn't too thrilled with the idea of applying it to Semantic Image Segmentation, in what would've been perhaps (with some rarely-credited DeepMind experiments at the time having already done it on CNNs) the first Vision Transformer (since it would've had to convincingly beat baseline scores on Computer Vision benchmarks). So instead, under an employment-contingent ultimatum, I co-wrote my ICCV [Taylor-CAM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.08601) paper under Chenliang with Henry and Charles. Charles and I managed to sneak biomedical modeling into the appendix (see Appendix J, rather understated and invisible).

I credited Charles as co-author on that paper, however they at the Med Center did not credit me for the prototype of the disease prognostication [model]((https://github.com/slerman12/DiseaseModeling)) (since developed since that original version mentioned [above](#charles-venuto)) and [website]((https://github.com/slerman12/DiseaseModelingWebApp)) I came up with, had to argue for, built, and presented in DC in front of reknowned Parkinson's disease researchers, a poster and live demo presentation that also wasn't credited (and not to mention was still amid the very peak of my benzo withdrawal).

Since Charles was the only person on the committee who knew me since I began the program, chronology/duration seems sufficiently relevant to mention here:

Besides the 4 years that people usually do in undergrad, 5 - 7 years is the average time for a person to do a PhD (I was in my 6th), with other students in the University of Rochester CS department going into their 7th year or more.

### Michael L. Scott

> The [eczema this is presently giving me](https://github.com/slerman12/BrokenWisdoms/blob/Ancillary/Eczema.md) as I type is severe. My arms are scathing red. I'm itchy and can't sleep, rolling around under my blankets in a burning panic, nails grinding to skin on arms, trying to shed the stress from this inflicted evil of judgement. The reader's possible mixed perceptions in my head, all the ways this could be re-done to be made more convincing and believed haunting the scorching thought rivers. Like ants on my arms literally, burning rivers as blood, my arteries need to be dug of their hidden psychological poison, my brain says; my brain pierces and threatens as it sends those coursing swarms stingingly down the lengths of my typing limbs, even now, as I try to put that burning disturbing pleasure and agony into words, if not the claws of my nails where skin residue bulks and swells. Please reader in the hidden ether, stop doing this to me. Send love, not this terror of threat and divided consciousness that broils as war between my body and the depths of my mind and senses.
>
> The torment doesn't stop until I finish this. I'm slave driven by my skin, as I was by my advisors, committees, and professors. I fear that you are all so stupid, that none of you will see the truth of this, that you will act as allies to the contagion that plagues my stress rather than as people who know the heart no matter the veil or law of land or powers that be.

Maybe one of the strongest Opposing Views, which the remainder of this book will be devoted to obliterating is the CS department Chair who comes in at this point for the first time in my PhD, Michael L. Scott (The Messenger as he might call himself), or: The Judge.

His Opposing View is only strong because of its window of context. Unlike Chenliang and Charles, he didn’t know me. Unlike Chris Kanan, he wasn’t in my field. And unlike Tom Howard, he didn’t and couldn’t have even been relevant to a six-month review, since he had no background or expertise whatsoever in anything relevant to the future of his field (to be fair) or mine. The future of his field is my field, for that matter.

That makes him an extremely strong Opposing View.

Michael made a lot of false allegations prior to and after terminating me, in fact almost entirely false allegations, entirely false or hypocritical allegations. For most of the time, his belief was that he was terminating me for more serious reasons than the six-month review make-up. He believed my research was inadequate, “unviable,” and that I had to propose a new research “plan.” “Plan” — in one’s 6th year when advisor and PI already believed I could defend on the work that I had that month.

My advisor and PI weren’t right, because I needed peace to write my thesis. That’s where Michael’s exercise in unearned ruling authority was the most extreme.

And suspicious.

I call this the Termination Slam.

His previous email read:

> ### $"$
> If I do not hear from you by 6 Oct., with a plan for successful completion, the department will terminate your stipend and discontinue your enrollment as of 31 Oct. 2023.
> ### $``$
> &ensp;&ensp;- **09/25/2023**

(Send the department my "new research plan" (despite the advisor and PI believing I was ready to defend) by **10/06/2023**, now an added independent requirement to the previously delivered materials).

Then I delivered another research plan, with precision and accuracy, by the specified date **10/06/2023**. 

This was the only reply I got, of **10/12/2023**:

> ### $"$
> Dear Sam:
>
> Thank you for your note of 6 Oct.  I have conferred with members of your committee.  They confirm that the plan you outline is neither consistent with what you originally proposed for the PhD nor a viable path to completion of the degree.  With regret, we will be terminating your student status and stipend as of the end of October.
>
> Yours,
> 
> Michael L. Scott (he/him) </br>
> Arthur Gould Yates Professor and Chair</br>
> Computer Science Department, University of Rochester</br>
> \<provided contact info redacted\>
> ### $``$
> &ensp;&ensp;- **10/12/2023**

I delivered what was requested and he put his boot down on my sincerity and effort. That boot despite what was threatened and said is why it was a Termination Slam, not just a termination. On personal and highly elaborate work that was sent to him (and CC'd Chenliang) in confidence about all of my research, and the plan to defend after I write my thesis.

Later, he specified the detail he didn’t like. No no, it wasn’t the research-related material, as he later self-contradicted, it was my request for “peace” towards the end.

However, this alone does not damn Michael. He was CC’d on or I sent him, *all* of the context. At first, he got the [medical context]() and only the research “context” from the brand new interim committee, later the research context, and gradually he realized that his only justification for the termination — despite what he previously specified — was a measly six-month review make-up, the one that was post-hoc both with respect to advisor desertion and requirement (which I warned [on **08/10/2023**](https://github.com/slerman12/BrokenWisdoms/blob/Ancillary/Not-Enough-Carbs.md) I wasn't going to attend, and Michael was CC'd), and which is a formalism that isn’t under any ordinary PhD circumstance considered that important.

But at that point he stayed doubled down.

The boss battle was over, and I lost.

That they are violating their own policy. And that mathematically derived disproof will appear in the Epilogue, not in the part titled "Disproof" (coming up next).</sub>

#

Michael doesn't know this, but he bumped my grade up in undergrad once. Now he ultimately relayed the ruling to terminate, on the basis of the committee, and not one, but, as he claimed, [two](https://github.com/slerman12/BrokenWisdoms/blob/main/7-Ongoing.md) six-month reviews (and this make-up!). Michael mentioned the possibility of applying for reinstatement, though what that means is unclear, especially as: Did he mean I needed to find yet another advisor, new source of funding, re-take a six-month review, do my thesis, and do all of this amid health issues in my 6th year, for less than New York State's legal living wage, within the next one to few months? 

See "Slavery or impossible" [here](https://github.com/slerman12/BrokenWisdoms/blob/main/3-Disproof.md) (in the next chapters) for elaboration on what was demanded on me *together with* the six-month review make-up.

For all of the aforementioned reasons, and final, I was terminated without degree. 6 years of hard work thrown away and spit on, with no accountability, from the same single monopoly and institution that induced multiple medical malpractices on me, mutilated me into looking like Gollum literally, and put me through a literal physiological coerced burning hellfire for more than a year that can't be described. Meanwhile, those years in the program involved two advisors leaving due to no fault of my own. I mentioned that in the second 3 years, I had to work for the Mechanical Engineering department, on research independent from my AI research. I can throw away that in the first 3, I had to work in the Medical Center for funding, even for months as I worked for Chenliang for free.

In summary, Michael Scott and a brand new interim committee, who had effectively never met me, decided to add to my advisor's decision, [for altogether different "reasons"](https://github.com/slerman12/BrokenWisdoms/blob/main/3-Disproof.md) than this six-month review make-up, then had to change their minds when they realized every research-related reason they gave on record was wrong. At the end, this make-up became their only recourse.

### Recap

The committee that terminated me was a brand new *interim* committee, for just one meeting, for which they post-hoc wanted a make-up before the next one that they wouldn’t even attend. 

Since I had to switch advisors, and my PI Niaz agreed to be on my defense committee (by my advisor’s suggestion just prior to the six-month review), and another committee member was returning, and assuming my old advisor would still remain on the committee, that means the entire brand new committee (3/4 members) — all of the ones who made the termination decision and ruled that I needed a new research “plan” in my 6th year — were leaving. After that one 20-minute video call, they assumed all governing power over my studies, labor, and employment, simply because other faculty members left without warning (abandoned/deserted their "posts") last-minute. More egregiously, in case that doesn’t stress it, 2/4 of them (3/5 if you count Michael) aren’t in my field and have no background or expertise in my field. The only 1/4 who did, next to my advisor, was Chris Kanan, the one who provided the [Deus Ex Memory](https://github.com/slerman12/BrokenWisdoms/blob/Ancillary/Deus-Ex-Memory.md) in which he forgot the meeting, and on whose behalf I invented a new RL systems algorithm in less than 2 months during this 3 month period. 
- If they appreciated my research, they wouldn't be interim. I wouldn't have notified them on **08/10/2023** that I would be returning their positions to the previously planned committee. I would've wanted to include all of them on my committee and give them credit and attribution for my thesis.

That’s the whole story, and where in there is even the slightest administrative sense or rational mandate to make life-altering decisions?

<br>From: University of Rochester, <a href="https://www.rochester.edu/college/deans/">Meet the Deans</a>.
</a>
</p>

"Meet the Deans!" Deans Wendi Heinzelman and Nick Vamivakas, who I flooded with a ton of emails, were CC’d on all of this, and didn’t reply to any of them — including, “Thanks Nick, I appreciate this.” about the Israel-Gaza situation affecting Jewish students that Nick sent out en-masse on the final October 31st end-of-my-student-employment day (about students-only university support groups for the Israel-Gaza situation, on the day I was about to be no longer a student-employee, and back when Israel wasn't in the wrong). I mistakenly thought it was a email directly to me since maybe he learned that my family, including me, immigrated here as Jewish refugees, since I mentioned that actually. No, they never emailed me or replied. It was also immediately before my birthday for that matter, but I’m sure these personal details don’t matter. Not a single reply.

## Additional details for part 1

1. Oh, I lost my fingernails. I forgot to mention that. They turned entirely purple and bended like putty. 
    - Some time after the I Ching reading, my nails were turning more purple and weak. They didn't fall out, but they were unusable and unmanageable. (They eventually grew back normal, after months to maybe a year).
    - I don't remember if the same thing happened to my toenails as fingernails. I was preoccupied with PhD work and already at the apex of night-marish and unprocessable decay.
2. My whole-body eczema and allergies also spiked for a prolonged time due to that sudden cessation/withdrawal.

## Additional details for part 2

1. TO DO: See if I can locate the discharge papers that said the outpatient doctor would wean me off the benzos.
2. TO DO: Add how Aetna (the University-provided health insurance) did it again, with a photo of the huge bills they suddenly started sending me 10 months into therapy for my psychologist.

## Additional details for part 3

1. Something I didn't mention or elaborate on here yet: Chenliang lied, as soon as I sent [my first email](https://github.com/slerman12/BrokenWisdoms/blob/Ancillary/Not-Enough-Carbs.md) to the committee. Here's a story that Chenliang knows is true: After he notified me of his leaving and my income being cut, I reached out my hand to shake his hand, he didn't shake it, and then I said, "I consider you someone I personally hold dear", and patted my heart with my hand as I left his office and another student entered. I meant it. That's why I refrained from telling the other committee members and Michael that Chenliang lied in his reply email until after they had formally notified me of my termination. This was the fabrication, on email: "Dr. Niaz Abdolrahim delivered my message to you [... that] I can continue to provide funding support (Sep, Oct, Nov)." No, she did not. She didn't say anything about continued funding support. She can confirm, though she didn't risk their professional relationship by replying either when I CC'd her. Even if she had offered any words of financial security for between then and November, November time limit before losing my funding and having to find my — what, fourth? After Charles, Henry, and Chenliang — PhD advisor, in my 6th year, on short-notice, in the context of the extreme work I did across many labs including mostly uncredited work, and what that same institution induced, would still be Kafkaesque and unacceptable.
2. I built a whole machine learning web app for the Med Center, professional and beautiful, a web app that prognosticated a patient's Parkinson's disease progression based on inputs using machine learning models that I trained, that they later outsourced to other much-higher-paid programmers who could scale it, and patented it, then ignored the fact that it was my idea, that I had to convince them of the idea, prove that it gets good reception by presenting it to major researchers at a conference in DC in front of them (uncredited), and that I literally built a fully functioning and elegant prototype, concluding with all of them pretending that I had no involvement as they were handing it over to build from scratch to a hired professional web dev team with me trying to chime in and getting ignored at the table as if it was a brand new idea that they didn't realize was in any way affiliated with me, and perhaps that was necessary for the patent.
