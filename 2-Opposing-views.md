## Part 1 

- **University-provided health insurance (Aetna)**
- **University-hospital doctor**
- **University-owned drug deliverer**

In the summer prior to my first year as a PhD student, my university-hospital doctor Lisa Beck prescribed a medication called Dupilumab. It's a biologic agent that you inject into your stomach that laser-targets a specific antibody associated with eczema. My eczema was severe and debilitating. Some time into taking the medication — I think maybe 8 months — my university-provided health insurance Aetna cut me off from the drug without warning. I wasn't notified by Aetna or my doctor, or the university-owned hospital, but by the university-owned intermediary deliverer, who was responsible for delivering the drug on a recurring basis to my doorstep, since it can't — or at least at the time couldn't — be provided for pick-up at a pharmacy. They called me and told me they couldn't reach my doctor, but for some reason Aetna had decided to no longer cover the prescription. I remember walking up and down Mt. Hope Avenue with my phone in a panic calling my doctor trying to reach her, and the university deliverer telling me they were trying to do the same and couldn't reach her either. After a while, my hair started falling out rapidly. I have no genetic predisposition to baldness, from any side of my family. The abnormally rapid hair loss was obviously due to the dependency and cessation. 

Though it fell out quickly, I didn't notice at first. The shower drains were filled with hair every day, and I thought it was maybe my housemate's girlfriend's. I didn't get to see my doctor until later in the Spring, a long time after, when I think much of the side and top of my head were bald. She diagnosed it as Alopecia Areata as a result of the sudden cessation of Dupilumab. To be clear, she diagnosed it as Alopecia Areata as a result of the sudden cessation of Dupilumab. She and her nurse took pictures and stored them in the university-hospital computers. 

Eventually, she sorted out things with the university-provided health insurance, but by then it was too late. Most of my hair had fallen out.

We finally got a delivery of the drug. I wasn’t sure whether it’d be safer at that point to re-instigate the dependency/addiction or avoid the drug at all costs.

Here's a personal story, since I was fixated with Taoism at the time:

To help me weigh the difficult decision — and it was difficult because that medication was extremely potent and didn't even help my eczema much, and I believed my hair would grow back — I asked the I Ching. Here I'll describe the hexagrams I got because I find it interesting that one of the predictions came true, and this might be medically useful since it corresponded thrice with my hair growing back (all three resurgences after the Alopecia Areata had developed into Alopecia Universalis, meaning after every piece of hair from my body had fallen out).

The I Ching "answered" it didn’t matter which of the two paths I chose ("The town may be changed, / But the well cannot be changed. / It neither decreases nor increases." - "The Well", unchanging). (Maybe an interesting observation: that the English "well" is phonetically similar to "wellness", as well). It also had previously "answered" my hair would grow back of its own accord, which it did, temporarily. I still remember: “Difficulty at the beginning” (as Richard Wilhelm described: “The name of the hexagram, Chun, really connotes a blade of grass pushing against an obstacle as it sprouts out of the earth — hence the meaning, 'Difficulty at the beginning'.”) $\rightarrow$ (changes to) “Fellowship with man” (e.g., baldness). That answer about whether my hair’d grow back came true with the all-steak diet (steak is "manly" and so that again ties to the hexagram symbolism of "Fellowship with man"), almost like a suggestion for how my hair could “sprout” out of the earth, my head, again… which it did, temporarily but covering my entire head except for an unnoticeable patch at the top of my scalp.

Then all the hair fell out again. Again, total baldness. No eyelashes, eyebrows, or hair.

Another time I did the all-steak diet, my pubic hair grew back — temporarily.

Another time I did the all-steak diet, a few eyelashes grew back for the first time. 

That can’t be a coincidence, so I leave this story here both for medical utility and for the understanding that [I now look like Gollum](https://www.facebook.com/photo/?fbid=10211230008185126&set=a.1273659620707) because of medical malpractice.

> By the way, the scariest nightmare I ever had, over and over that whole night, was the day I injected Dupilumab the first time. I remember my housemate at the time in the other room and I wanted to wake him. That's how scared I was. The nightmare was of a tall skinny slenderman, who kept approaching to rape me. Every time I closed my eyes and fell asleep, he'd reappear. Again and again, for that whole night. I never had a nightmare like that before. It was vivid.

<!-- <br><i><b>Note:</b> I finished making this diagram just as Pink Floyd's "Comfortably Numb" started playing on my Spotify, a song about a doctor taking a patient named "Pink"'s soul through "medicines" meant to help him. The next song was "Psycho Killer" which I'll interpret as psychiatric killer. Oh and then "Alabama  Song (Whisky Bar)." Not bad. Any song about alcohol is fitting for the topic of benzos, since they both work by GABA as the mechanism of action. In fact, I introduced a fellow hospital-inmate Lily to Elliott Smith for the first time with the song "Between the Bars" (about alcohol... not about Xanax bars [Xanax is another benzo and "bars" is the colloquially and sometimes clinically used term for pills of them]) while we were in the hospital (between the bars of confinement). Since she was keeping a synchronicity list while we were there, I think she'll appreciate these observations in this caption when I show her, though it would unfortunately be a non-sequitor to make any claims to their nature or significance. Some of these however are just linguistic.</i> -->

## Part 2

- **University-hospital psychiatrists**
- **University outpatient doctor**
- **University-hospital police officers**
- **University psychiatric ward janitor**

### Psychiatrists

This is going to be hard. What the fuck can I say? I was going to exclude this whole section. This is night-marish and you should be scared. Oh friendly psychiatrist pops in to tell me that they can't stop the benzodiazapine coercion. No, that's not the beginning...

Eczema leads to hair loss leads to depression and worsening psychiatric state. I get hospitalized. They force me to take benzodiazepines. I can barely recall those days because the dosage was so high... and I was \*so high\*. Benzos are potent medications that have alcohol-like effects and even an alcohol-like mechanism of action. So those days were a blur. But the thing with benzos is, the longer you take them, the more your brain downregulates. Because your brain knows they're poison, so your brain catches all the fancy GABA explosions and goes, "hmm, no something's wrong..." and its system-wide neurons stop producing GABA, the neurotransmitter that's 1/2 of the two primary chemical messengers in your brain.

Damn. I'm sorry. This is too hard. 

Clinicians come in, telling me I have to keep taking the benzos. It's not my choice. In the hospital, it was either that or court order. The dose is huge, bigger than I'd ever taken. And I'm familiar with benzo dose calculations because I had a prescription before, for stress-induced and stress-inducing eczema, and social anxiety. And I remember carefully tabulating when I could take one because they reduced social anxiety. I knew they were dangerous. I warily took a quarter to a half of a milligram before, less than once per every two weeks, if that, and that much left hangover symptoms. Not major hangovers, not like alcohol, but noticeable, next-day drowsiness and mental blurriness. This was before the hospitalization, at the once at most two weeks rate. The hospital rate was beyond unprecedented for me.

I had to stay there for a month and they forced me to take 48x that dosage reduced later to 12x that dosage, over the course of 3 times per day, every day. Think about that. 1/4 to 1/2 of a milligram, once every two weeks at most, had side effects. 48x-12x that dosage, every day.

Accounting for dosage *and* rate, that’s a minimum 672x-168x to 336x-84x increase.

I'm 5'5" 110lb.

That whole month was a “blast”, thanks (1) to Lily being there in the psychiatric ward with me and two other friends I'd made, but also because (2) I was high as “complete balls” the whole time, except as my brain's gabaminergic system caught wind and began to downregulate GABA. But the chemical waterboarding only began there.

They said they'd wean me off before I was discharged, but changed their minds. Perhaps they saw how different the drugs made my personality and made the mistake of thinking they were treating the underlying root of something. There were two psychiatrists. The first one seemed to want to wean me off. The second one, I don't remember her name because I don't remember most names from that metaphorical airplane flight, was a tall Asian woman and she changed the first psychiatrist's decision last-minute and said the outpatient doctor would wean me off after the hospitalization, though they did gradually reduce the dose.

He didn't, and he was a bastard. I saw him for 6 months and don't remember his name either. But not because of being high. At that point, I was in severe cognitive decline. And the euphoria was turning into excruciating anxiety and fear, and then gray cloud and fog, and terror. I should've weaned myself off, but not only did the drug effect impair my cognition, but because of the terror-state I was in due to the drug, my self-confidence was too low to defy my doctor’s orders, even as every rational thought told me I should. I listened to him for six months, arguing as he kept vaguely prolonging a distant eventual taper date, for no justification specified other than falling back on clinical authority. I argued and I think that's most of what contributed to his doubling down.

3 months in, after reporting that I was brain damaged, he didn't believe me and wanted to increase the dose. I begged him to taper, and he thought if I was having all those negative symptoms, that the dose must've been too low.

I can't describe this.

This diagram is an original understanding of the  computational neuron with a differentiable analog implemented <a href="https://github.com/slerman12/UnifiedMLold2/tree/master/Blocks/Architectures/LermanBlocks/BioNeuron">here</a>. 

Here is a [video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1i5hS2iDVuo24PnGicvn5dIZYXUzDfPAl/view?usp=share_link) I made on the topic.

#

Let's begin a simplified explanation of the brain's neuron. Neurons are cells that are connected to one each other by dendrites and axons that pass chemical messengers from one neuron to downstream neurons. The two most common chemical messengers in the brain are the excitatory neurotransmitter Glutamate and the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA. Excitatory means they cause the next neuron to also release their neurotransmitters ("fire"). Inhibitory means they lower the voltage activity of the next neuron such that the next neuron is subdued. GABA is the mechanism of action of alcohol. People think alcohol is "disinhibitory", that it "disinhibits" them, but the reality is alcohol is actually inhibitory. It confuses GABA receptors into activating, causing an inhibition of that neuron and all the neurons in your brain. It's a system-wide drug that indiscriminately simulates GABA throughout every part of your brain, from the Occipital lobe, where your eyes see (in the back of your head), to the frontal lobe, where your brain thinks it thinks.

Benzos are GABA agonists, like alcohol. That means they simulate GABA or enhance GABA receptor function. But unlike the alcohol simulation evolved readily by the fermentation of fruit abundant in nature, benzos have not been integrated into the biological balancing mechanisms of the brain. They are more synthetic, and far more insidious, because they get around the brain's securities more, so much so that you might not even notice a headache the next day. Seems like a Godsend, a Panacea, but it's not. Because they are worse than alcohol. As a result of the influx of poison, the brain downregulates GABA production and receptor sensitivity universally across the brain, including Hippocampal memory, with no habituated cleaning mechanism. I couldn't even remember details about my grandparents' birth dates and death dates.

Nobody understands this mechanism. To understand this mechanism, you'd have to solve all of neurology and artificial intelligence, and psychiatrists definitely don't. The diagram I show by the way is novel. Benzos are a floodbath of GABA to your brain, that your brain responds to by "downregulation": every neuron in the brain that is inhibited by GABA (that's almost every neuron in the brain) is directly affected. So we don't even understand the mechanisms of long-term memory and psychiatrists feel equipped to coerce their own interventions on that and everything else in the brain. Lack of GABA, as a result of GABA downregulation, then results in higher proportions of excitatory Glutamate than inhibitory GABA and more of your neurons firing, which can lead to epileptic seizures, a frequently observed result of regular benzodiazepine usage. It also leads to immense Hell, since GABA downregulation is anxiety itself. Think of the most anxious you've ever been in your life. That's at least in part because of GABA downregulation. Having your brain's GABA downregulated is like living actively in a warzone. It is, without exaggeration, a form of legalized torture. Coerced benzo usage is neurochemical waterboarding. I mean that: we're not talking about some small evil. Benzo users report addiction and withdrawal worse than cocaine or heroin. Not long ago lobotomies and conversion therapies were standard. History will recognize the barbarism of the current psychiatric practices around coercion, in particular of benzodiazepines. Scientific studies en masse support the position that benzos have negative long-term and sometimes permanent neurological effects and have supported this position since studies from the 1990s.

> By the way, I made these arguments to my outpatient doctor, and without any specific retort, he insisted on increasing the dosage. There is an authority/power play dynamic between psychiatrists and the patients they oversee, where literal healing is secondary to something else.

### Hospitalization

> TLDR: I describe Mobi, a 16 year old who they kept hostage and made take benzos for probably longer than I did, Hudson who they electroshocked, Jeremiah a nice guy who was never even the slightest violent who the university-hospital police officers tackled and pinned down violently on a driveway, and Lily (not real name), a 24 year old who had sex with a 50-something janitor in the university psychiatric ward.

Describing these events is really hard. I'm gonna try to do it in story form (at least for interpretability). I really want to do justice to the injustice, but in story form, it might not. The only way I can think to frame these events is around the context of someone I met in the hospital, Lily. She made the month there tolerable and enjoyable. Without her, like on other hospitalizations, like one where I was kept in the geriatric unit for elderly patients, the hospital environment and coercions would've been traumatic. And they were, before and after, for different reasons.

Lily was 24 when we met. While I was there, we played Guitar Hero with our friend Hudson and another guy. I got her to do yoga, since I was still doing all my yoga and meditation regimen while there and, later, meditation with me. Literally this is stream of consciousness, but: even when she was in coke withdrawal later in hospital-provided housing after our hospitalization, I got her to slow down from the extreme tortured state and we meditated together. I even gave her a mantra, one I gleaned once somewhat illegitimately from the Transcendental Meditation (TM) list of Vedic mantras, perhaps a bad idea but the Vedic-sounding formalism got her to value the meditation session. No wait, it was one my mom used, I never did anything with the illegitimate ones except use the adjacent information to learn more about what the "advanced techniques" were about since I was skeptical. My mom and I got ours legitimately through the TM program. Mine has a coincidental meaning today but I'm not allowed to say what it is because in TM, mantras are usually kept personal but my mom already told me her's and doesn't meditate much and Lily needed it. Mantra meditations are scientifically backed by the way. And pop culturally, they aren't woo woo either. TM is the program the Beatles endorsed that the song "Across the Universe" is about. Jerry Seinfeld among others, like Russell Brand and the director of Twin Peaks David Lynch, pretty adamantly endorsed TM as well, not to mention plural millennia of Upanishad wisdom and the recent influx of analogous techniques in non-psychoactive therapeutic practice that teach overlapping disciplines. Personally, I don't endorse anything because I don't want to be accountable for a stranger's (as opposed to friend's) bad experiences with a meditation that might have better studied alternatives with blame placeable elsewhere. Backtracking to the hospital again, I was also doing Pranayama as well, a breathing technique, and eating extremely healthy (my mom was even bringing in my Paleo-diet food as a substitute for the food the hospital had, that I shared with Lily as well since she really liked that food, and probably would've been glad to eat a diet like that if the hospital had any real substitute for the processed garbage they served out, itself a drug). I really did not need to be inoculated against my will with floodbaths of benzos for the next >6 months. [TO DO: Edit this paragraph. I only include it to make the point that my health practices were far too healthy for psychiatrists to be dictating what potent psychoactive drugs go into my body. If anything, I should have been dictating their practices.]

In the hospital-provided housing that she had when I came to visit, her neighbor made food, a huge meal, pork chops and mashed potatoes and surprisingly all really good food. We then ate a Thanksgiving dinner with her neighbor. I brought yams I'd made previously before the invitation, not knowing I was going to be visiting/staying there for Thanksgiving. 

She told me at that hangout she had sex with the 50-something year old psychiatric ward janitor while hospitalized. I think she said he was her most recent boyfriend, that they got into a relationship afterwards that lasted some time, and she'd broken up with him. 

While she and I were in the hospital, backtracking again, our third companion was Hudson. When I was being discharged, he wrote me this long letter that included the line, "I hope you remember me when your an Icon of the world." He was electroshocked weekly during my stay there. For depression. Electrovolts of lightning in an electric chair for his depression. 

<p align="center">
<img width="300" alt="Screenshot 2024-03-12 at 8 10 34 PM" src="https://github.com/slerman12/Detective-Sam/assets/9126603/d5414cba-2012-42f9-b516-f06dd8760cad">
</p>

It's amazing he could write at all after the electrocution they put him through. I guess pharmaceuticals didn't seem sufficiently crucial to the core of his depression that they believed hooking him up to a car battery would make more sense.

Meanwhile, little did I know — and actually quite a lot since I made the case quite articulately — I was being brain damaged and chemically waterboarded.

My friend Jeremiah, someone so kind it's not even funny, went through something different while he was there. He told me the university-hospital police officers held him down and choked him for trying to escape, tackled and pinned him down violently on pavement, and that his medications once caused him to have a seizure. Having undergone physical assaults from the university-hospital police myself, due also to efforts to leave containment, and once in the grass outside, and burned alive in the downregulation nightmare, I can say it’s unpleasant. 

Those events are listed in the reverse chronological order by the way, combative efforts to escape only appearing in later hospitalizations that followed the multi-year benzo nightmare.

Finally, Mobi, this guy I met there at a different hospitalization. He actually braided Lily's hair, I later found out. When you have people in there with you, it's actually palatable. But when you're alone, kept hostage, for prolonged periods, against your will, under constant overwatch and coercion, it's not the same story. Mobi was 16, also prescribed benzos like I was, but he was there much longer. Years, in and out. This is the part I can't even believe as I write: he was in there for drug problems and addiction. No wonder: they were feeding him the most potent addictive chemicals on the known planet by force. Yes: to be clear: they'd been giving him benzos for 2 years at that point, on and off, from the age of 14. Acclimating to benzos, yes, your brain is going to feel deprived of GABA and you will want drugs.

And he was intelligent and respectful and well mannered. There is no way he should've been in the hospital. He could've been a revolution leader or some shit.

> The fact that I can cite injustice for all 5 people I know who went through the system suggests that the absolute injustice rate is probably pretty damn high.

The next part of the story conveys some of my trauma, and it's the hardest to write about. I might not... Hold on...

### My... trauma

</p>

I was in severe agony three months in, the doctor refused to help with the taper and wanted to increase the dose, and I had to keep taking them, then I was in severely worse agony six months in. I wasn't able to recall important facts or do basic math. I had no choice and had to taper off by myself, and thank God I did because at that point, you might not agree with calling it brain damage, but it literally was, and if I'm speaking metaphorically, it was active chemical waterboarding. Then the agony persisted for more than a year after, indescribable, severe and debilitating. 

Laying on the couch for a year, immobilized, shaking with excruciating agony. No sleep, no escape. No exit, just PhD work and torture. Skin dry, teeth calcifying (at a dental cleaning appointment, the hygienist diagnosed it as calcification and the attributed cause as dry mouth due to benzodiazepines), no memory, no linguistic expression, cognition completely gray and burning. All color gone, all imagery, all imagination, only pain, perpetual pain and fear. Terror. Terror terror terror. I wasn't able to do 4*7. They say the only thing to fear is fear itself: GABA downregulation is fear itself. The experience is like being in a warzone. It's like burning alive — without stop — more than a year, torture. The neurochemical experience is literally what you go through if you're in a warzone, and being chased by a predator, while in the middle of having a seizure: hellfire, indescribable pain. I've read former cocaine and heroin addicts say the withdrawal of long-term benzo addiction is worse than for cocaine or heroin.

That Hell from the GABA downregulation didn't go away for more than a year, though the linguistics seem to want to say "for a full year" everytime I type this, even though more than a year and possibly ongoing is more accurate. Every neuron in my brain was behaving as if I was being mauled by a bear, without pause, day and night, every minute.

Not to mention the paranoia and distrust built from undergoing coercion, repeatedly being told I was going to be weaned off, with their attempts to reassure me turning out to be straight-up lies.

The experience of losing my hair has cost me relationships and worsened my social anxiety, and the benzo-brain damage and torture leaves me with PTSD.

## Part 3

- **University PhD advisors**
- **University PhD committee members**
- **University graduate administrator and Deans**

<p align="center">
<img width="300" alt="Screenshot 2024-03-12 at 8 08 29 PM" src="https://github.com/slerman12/BrokenWisdoms/assets/9126603/38c120aa-7b20-4c91-a302-7fad96b52d06">
</p>

There were further terrors at the University of Rochester Medical Center that I don't want to get into (one of the easier ones to point out, that happened later, was my big toe getting running over by the wheelchair I was in as the nurse pushed it, me screaming in pain, and with the nurse rolling me off and other nurses all ignoring). Concurrent with this, while I was still in withdrawal from the benzodiazepines and after my third year in the PhD program, I was forced to switch from being Henry Kautz's student because Henry got a prestigious position offer to direct at the NSF that he accepted. In defense of Henry, he'd already done a lot for me, and had no formal background or experience with deep learning to facilitate my research studies compared to, who he recommended, Chenliang Xu, whose lab I had to then fight to get into, with an ultimatum pressed on me to write a top-venue paper, from scratch, by the end of that summer for him or be rejected advisor-less from the PhD program.

<p align="center">
<img width="400" alt="Screenshot 2024-03-12 at 8 08 29 PM" src="https://github.com/slerman12/BrokenWisdoms/assets/9126603/b8c27acf-2fdf-4ea2-93a4-eae66deb8c12">
</p>

In defense of Chenliang: he eventually accepted me into his lab (when I succesfully delivered that paper, even early, while still in the nightmare depths of the benzo withdrawal), and stayed generally nice throughout the time, while not expressing judgement towards my social anxiety. He sometimes had a good understanding of AI, better than others at the university. His spirit, sometimes, felt extraordinarily supportive. He contradictorily wanted efficiency with somewhat respecting my slower publication pace while I built UnifiedML, and I believed he fully knew that I was intelligent enough to warrant investing faith in. While 2 publications in 3 years is (I think) less than his average student, that was, however, his only reason for terminating me when I was in my sixth year, three years later, an average number of publications.

For context, Henry's average was 1 - 3 across the PhD student's full tenure.

<p align="center">
<img width="340" alt="Screenshot 2024-03-12 at 8 10 34 PM" src="https://github.com/slerman12/BrokenWisdoms/assets/9126603/2c912a3b-d85a-4112-ad2c-596c9b502099">
</p>

In defense of the committee members who agreed on the decision, most of them didn't know me and hadn't met each other or me previously, and one of them, in a kind of *deus ex machina* (or so I thought, since that should have conclusively settled it), [mis-remembered](https://github.com/slerman12/BrokenWisdoms/blob/main/4-Faith.md) the short 30-minute Zoom only meeting that the four of us had, on which these decisions from their end were based, as being 1.5 hours and twice. That is quite a lapse in memory. The meeting was 30 minutes, and once, as the other committee members may recall and confirm. And, the calendar invitation that that committee member, Chris Kanan, accepted, wrote: "Friday May 5, 2023 ⋅ 1pm – 1:45pm (Eastern Time - New York)" (extra lag time added). Also, I have on email to one committee member Tom Howard that we planned half an hour: "Would you be available any of the following dates for a half-hour remote 6-month review?" So, as can be easily confirmed or sufficiently evidenced, it was indeed 30 minutes with our brand new committee in which I had to summarize 6 years of work over Zoom: 20ish minutes spent on my presentation and the remaining on their independent-room discussion and concluding remarks.

The independent-room discussion reasonably marked the end of my portion of the meeting, or so I thought. However, after the independent-room discussion, we kept talking, I left, and Chenliang later told me that the committee members thought I dropped the line early. That was a misunderstanding. I really thought the meeting was over since they conveyed everything I had to do next, or at least that they were going to in that discussion. At the very, very end of the discussion, one of the committee members, Tom Howard, said, “I just want to add, I think it’s important.” I actually in my sleep deprivation thought he meant my work (I know he probably meant the chapter-list), so I did a sincere and prolonged “bless you” sign with my hands in the silence and left. I know that this is the least believable part. Chenliang knew I hadn’t slept that whole night, due to insomnia and maybe-nervousness, and I mentioned that I "didn't sleep all night" during the meeting to which I think Tom Howard off-handedly, maybe-non-noticedly said "I know," before resuming his point.

Since Charles Venuto was the only person on the committee who knew me since I began the program, when I worked for him in the Medical Center in my undergrad and in the [first 3 years](https://github.com/slerman12/BrokenWisdoms/blob/main/5-Early-work-in-program.md) of my PhD, including at one point as my funding source for my PhD even as I worked for free for Chenliang, I reassured him via email, without prompt, not to worry, out of that same sincere/maybe-naive kindness that I suspect is hard to believe. The other previous committee members, from those [first 5 years of my PhD](https://github.com/slerman12/BrokenWisdoms/blob/main/6-Indebted.md), had not been available for reasons that had nothing to do with me (besides my first advisor leaving, there was also retirement, sabbatical, and then second advisor leaving — 4 huge unexpected departures that the grad school should've had to be accountable for). After the meeting, I was formally sent two requirements, one with a June 5th deadline and another with a August 30th deadline. In addition to that, committee member Chris Kanan made recommendations on email that I innovate some new systems-level RL algorithm for UnifiedML. It was a good vague suggestion. I actually did this, successfully, and reported it to Chenliang later. I also met the first deadline, with everything as requested and additional information and longer page-count. Independent to that meeting, and prior to any confrontations or that second deadline, Chenliang stated that he would no longer support me in the Fall due to not enough papers, on July 24th. I achieved 2 papers in the 3 years under Chenliang and was in the middle of a paper review. On August 30th, I informed the grad school of everything and missed the make-up review, matching another time, as Michael will illucidate, that I missed a review due to highly extenuating and excused circumstances. After multiple contradictory reasons, they finally decided this (the missed August 30th make-up review) was the reason for terminating me in my sixth year as a PhD student (and tenth at the University of Rochester). In summary, a brand new committee, who had never met me, decided to confer with my advisor's decision, for altogether different "reasons".

Now, in defense of Dr. Michael L. Scott, the messenger:

<img width="200" alt="Screenshot 2024-03-12 at 8 10 54 PM" src="https://github.com/slerman12/Detective-Sam/assets/9126603/842ceaeb-90cc-49cf-b885-961c05a61de8">
</p>

Michael doesn't know this, but he bumped my grade up in undergrad once. Now he ultimately relayed the ruling to terminate, on the basis of the committee, and not one, but, as he claimed, [two](https://github.com/slerman12/BrokenWisdoms/blob/main/7-Ongoing.md) six-month reviews. Michael mentioned the possibility of applying for reinstatement, though what that means is unclear, especially as: Did he mean I needed to find yet another advisor, new source of funding, re-take a six-month review, do my thesis, and do all of this amid health issues in my sixth year, for less than New York State's legal living wage, within the next one to few months? 

The eczema this is presently giving me as I type is severe. My arms are scathing red. I'm itchy and can't sleep, rolling around under my blankets in a burning panic, nails grinding to skin on arms, trying to shed the stress from this inflicted evil of judgement. The reader's possible mixed perceptions in my head, all the ways this could be re-done to be made more convincing and believed haunting the scorching thought rivers. Like ants on my arms literally, burning rivers as blood, my arteries need to be dug of their hidden psychological poison, my brain says, my brain pierces and threatens as it sends those coursing swarms stingingly down the lengths of my typing limbs, even now, as I try to put that burning disturbing pleasure and agony into words, if not the claws of my nails where skin residue bulks and swells. Please reader in the hidden ether, stop doing this to me. Send love, not this terror of threat and divided consciousness that broils as war between my body and the depths of my mind and senses.

The torment doesn't stop until I finish this. I'm slave driven by my skin, as I was by my advisors, committees, and professors. I fear that you are all so stupid, that none of you will see the truth of this, that you will act as allies to the contagion that plagues my stress rather than as empaths who know the heart no matter the veil or law of land or powers that be.

Something I didn't mention or elaborate on here yet: Chenliang lied, as soon as I sent [my first email](https://github.com/slerman12/BrokenWisdoms/blob/main/4-Faith.md) to the committee. Here's a story that Chenliang knows is true: After he notified me of his leaving and my income being cut, I reached out my hand to shake his hand, he didn't shake it, and then I said, "I consider you someone I personally hold dear", and patted my heart with my hand as I left his office and another student entered. I meant it. That's why I refrained from telling the other committee members and Michael that Chenliang lied in his reply email until after they had formally notified me of my termination. This was the fabrication, on email: "Dr. Niaz Abdolrahim delivered my message to you [... that] I can continue to provide funding support (Sep, Oct, Nov)." No, she did not. She didn't say anything about continued funding support. She can confirm, though she didn't risk their professional relationship by replying either when I CC'd her. Even if she had offered any words of financial security for between then and November, November time limit before losing my funding and having to find my third PhD advisor, in my sixth year, on short-notice, in the context of the extreme work I did across many labs including mostly uncredited work, and what that same institution induced, would still be Kafkaesque and unacceptable.

<p align="center">
<img width="330" alt="Screenshot 2024-05-13 at 7 40 22 PM" src="https://github.com/slerman12/BrokenWisdoms/assets/9126603/19b2fdd0-4fc0-4f2e-bb2a-54dad5fa334f">
</p>

Niaz, perhaps an "opposing view", though someone I really like, was my other principle investigator together with Chenliang, for whose group I did a lot of programming, engineering, data generation and pipeline-optimizing, schematic-creating, and grant-idea-providing-and-writing work. When Chenliang told me he couldn't be my advisor, I asked Niaz if she could be. She said she couldn't, because she was in the Mechanical Engineering department and that the process of transferring departments isn't easy enough to be my new advisor, and that maybe she could reach out to the Dean about my concerns. She also advised that I reach out to the CARE Network, something I at first took some mild offense to, because I'd relayed to her some of that trauma with specifics, and she clarified, no, she meant reaching out to them for a lawyer. I appreciated that.  I'm grateful Chenliang forced me on that project. But, I did a lot for them in the Mechanical Engineering department, concurrent with my studies in AI separately in his lab, and I had no choice because that project's grants, that I helped write, was the source of my funding, with their names as authors and me uncredited. As mentioned, I did a lot of engineering and data work that was independent to my research for them, that ordinarily would get paid a 6-figure salary for, while I have never been paid more than $15/hr in my life.

However, that lab is the least of the work I did ([here](https://github.com/slerman12/BrokenWisdoms/blob/main/5-Early-work-in-program.md)/[here](https://github.com/slerman12/BrokenWisdoms/blob/main/6-Indebted.md)/[here](https://github.com/AGI-init/UnifiedML-legacy)/[here](https://github.com/AGI-init/XRDs)/[here](https://github.com/slerman12/Builder)/[here](https://github.com/AGI-init/Tributaries)/[here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ZQFeiOKSU2teVGg5EHlgREAi8pJY_Mr1CJ3H2pfFBfI/edit?usp=sharing)).

For all of the aforementioned reasons, and final, I was terminated without degree. 6 years of hard work thrown away and spit on, with no accountability, from the same single monopoly and institution that induced multiple medical malpractices on me, mutilated me into looking like Gollum literally, and put me through a literal physiological coerced burning hellfire for more than a year that can't be described. Meanwhile, those years in the program involved two advisors leaving due to no fault of my own, and extremely unreasonable grad school action, that goes in contrast to how much I actually did and how hard I worked more than they'll ever realize. I mentioned that in the second 3 years, I had to work for the Mechanical Engineering department, on research independent from my AI research. I can throw away that in the first 3, I had to work in the Medical Center for funding, even for a time as I worked for Chenliang for free. I built a whole machine learning web app for them, professional and beautiful, a web app that prognosticated a patient's Parkinson's disease progression based on inputs using machine learning models that I trained, that they later outsourced to other much-higher-paid programmers who could scale it, and patented it, then ignored the fact that it was my idea, that I had to convince them of the idea, prove that it gets good reception by presenting it to major researchers at a conference in DC in front of them (uncredited), and that I literally built a fully functioning and elegant prototype, concluding with all of them pretending that I had no involvement as they were handing it over to build from scratch to a hired professional web dev team with me trying to chime in and getting ignored at the table as if it was a brand new idea that they didn't realize was in any way affiliated with me, and perhaps that was necessary for the patent. That's a throw-away. Keep reading, just wait. There's really no end to the egregiousness of what the University of Rochester has bureaucratically instituted in their learning and healing centers, against every principle both of those institutions have ever claimed to hold.

Finally, Deans Wendi Heinzelman and Nick Vamivakas, who I flooded with a ton of emails, were CC’d on all of this, and didn’t reply to any of them — including, “Thanks Nick, I appreciate this.” about the Israel-Gaza situation affecting Jewish students that Nick sent out en-masse on the final October 31st day (about students-only university support groups for the Israel-Gaza situation, on the day I was denounced as a student). I mistakenly thought it was a email directly to me since maybe he learned that my family, including me, immigrated here as Jewish refugees. No, he never addressed me. It was also immediately before my birthday for that matter, but I’m sure these personal details don’t matter to them. They never acknowledged me, not a single reply.

> Note: None of these words do me justice. These words come from the trauma-mouth of some psychological framework that overtakes my genuine voice, rooted in memory of that institution's culture.
>
> Add an "Aetna did it again" section witha photo of the huge bills they suddenly started sending me more than half a year into therapy.
>
> See if I can locate the discharge papers that said the outpatient doctor would wean me off the benzos.

### Additional details for part 1

1. Oh, I lost my fingernails. I forgot to mention that. They turned entirely purple and bended like putty. I couldn’t cut them as they shredded.
    - Some time after the I Ching reading, my nails were turning more purple and weak. They didn't fall out, but they were unusable and unmanageable. (They eventually grew back normal, after months to maybe a year).
    - I don't remember if the same thing happened to my toenails as fingernails. I was preoccupied with PhD work and already at the apex of night-marish and unprocessable decay.
2. My whole-body eczema and allergies also spiked (for about a month).
