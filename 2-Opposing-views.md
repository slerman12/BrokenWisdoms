## Part 1 

- **University-provided health insurance (Aetna)**
- **University-hospital doctor**
- **University-owned drug deliverer**

In the summer prior to my first year as a PhD student, my university-hospital doctor Lisa Beck prescribed a medication called Dupilumab. It's a biologic agent that you inject into your stomach that laser-targets a specific antibody associated with eczema. My eczema was severe and debilitating. Some time into taking the medication — I think maybe 8 months — my university-provided health insurance Aetna cut me off from the drug without warning. I wasn't notified by Aetna or my doctor, or the university-owned hospital, but by the university-owned intermediary deliverer, who was responsible for delivering the drug on a recurring basis to my doorstep, since it can't — or at least at the time couldn't — be provided for pick-up at a pharmacy. They called me and told me they couldn't reach my doctor, but for some reason Aetna had decided to no longer cover the prescription. I remember walking up and down Mt. Hope Avenue with my phone in a panic calling my doctor trying to reach her, and the university deliverer telling me they were trying to do the same and couldn't reach her either. After a while, my hair started falling out rapidly. I have no genetic predisposition to baldness, from any side of my family. The abnormally rapid hair loss was obviously due to the dependency and cessation. 

Though it fell out quickly, I didn't notice at first. The shower drains were filled with hair every day, and I thought it was maybe my housemate's girlfriend's. I didn't get to see my doctor until later in the Spring, a long time after, when I think much of the side and top of my head were bald. She diagnosed it as Alopecia Areata as a result of the sudden cessation of Dupilumab. To be clear, she diagnosed it as Alopecia Areata as a result of the sudden cessation of Dupilumab. She and her nurse took pictures and stored them in the university-hospital computers. 

Eventually, she sorted out things with the university-provided health insurance, but by then it was too late. Most of my hair had fallen out.

We finally got a delivery of the drug. I wasn’t sure whether it’d be safer at that point to re-instigate the dependency/addiction or avoid the drug at all costs.

Here's a personal story, since I was fixated with Taoism at the time:

To help me weigh the difficult decision — and it was difficult because that medication was extremely potent and didn't even help my eczema much, and I believed my hair would grow back — I asked the I Ching. Here I'll describe the hexagrams I got because I find it interesting that one of the predictions came true, and this might be medically useful since it corresponded thrice with my hair growing back (all three resurgences after the Alopecia Areata had developed into Alopecia Universalis, meaning after every piece of hair from my body had fallen out).

The I Ching "answered" it didn’t matter which of the two paths I chose ("The town may be changed, / But the well cannot be changed. / It neither decreases nor increases." - "The Well", unchanging). (Maybe an interesting observation: that the English "well" is phonetically similar to "wellness," as well). It also had previously "answered" my hair would grow back of its own accord, which it did, temporarily. I still remember: “Difficulty at the beginning” (as Richard Wilhelm described: “The name of the hexagram, Chun, really connotes a blade of grass pushing against an obstacle as it sprouts out of the earth — hence the meaning, 'Difficulty at the beginning'.”) $\rightarrow$ (changes to) “Fellowship with man” (e.g., baldness). That answer about whether my hair’d grow back came true with the steak-only diet (steak is "manly" and so that again ties to the hexagram symbolism of "Fellowship with man"), almost like a suggestion for how my hair could “sprout” out of the earth, my head, like blades of grass, again… which it did, temporarily but covering my entire head except for an unnoticeable patch at the top of my scalp.

Then all the hair fell out again. Again, total baldness. No eyelashes, eyebrows, or hair.

Another time I did the steak-only diet, my pubic hair fully grew back — temporarily.

Another time I did the steak-only diet, a few eyelashes grew back for the first time. 

That can’t be a coincidence, so I leave this story here both for medical utility and for the understanding that [I now look like Gollum](https://www.facebook.com/photo/?fbid=10211230008185126&set=a.1273659620707) because of medical malpractice.

> By the way, the scariest nightmare I ever had, over and over that whole night, was the day I injected Dupilumab the first time. I remember my housemate at the time in the other room and I wanted to wake him. That's how scared I was. The nightmare was of a tall skinny slenderman, who kept approaching to rape me. Every time I closed my eyes and fell asleep, he'd reappear. Again and again, for that whole night. I never had a nightmare like that before. It was vivid.

<!-- <br><i><b>Note:</b> I finished making this diagram just as Pink Floyd's "Comfortably Numb" started playing on my Spotify, a song about a doctor taking a patient named "Pink"'s soul through "medicines" meant to help him. The next song was "Psycho Killer" which I'll interpret as psychiatric killer. Oh and then "Alabama  Song (Whisky Bar)." Not bad. Any song about alcohol is fitting for the topic of benzos, since they both work by GABA as the mechanism of action. In fact, I introduced a fellow hospital-inmate Lily to Elliott Smith for the first time with the song "Between the Bars" (about alcohol... not about Xanax bars [Xanax is another benzo and "bars" is the colloquially and sometimes clinically used term for pills of them]) while we were in the hospital (between the bars of confinement). Since she was keeping a synchronicity list while we were there, I think she'll appreciate these observations in this caption when I show her, though it would unfortunately be a non-sequitor to make any claims to their nature or significance. Some of these however are just linguistic.</i> -->

## Part 2

- **University-hospital psychiatrists**
- **University outpatient doctor**
- **University-hospital police officers**

This is going to be hard. What the fuck can I say? I was going to exclude this whole section. This is night-marish and you should be scared. Oh friendly psychiatrist pops in to tell me that they can't stop the benzodiazapine coercion. No, that's not the beginning...

Eczema leads to hair loss leads to depression and worsening psychiatric state…

### House on May St.

My hair fell out while I lived in *my house on May St.*, a miraculous situation where the landlord — who I’d never met previously — rented me a 4-bedroom nice antique house near both the university and the park in Rochester where the Lilac Festival is held, to myself, for $600/month, starting Fall, 2017 — well, technically one bedroom from that house, but I had the whole place to myself pretty much for the next year, and even furnished at least one other bed from another room since, inexplicably and literally miraculously, the landlord didn't believe he could find anyone on his own without my help to rent out to, and he wanted grad students. 

I did end up renting out the attic (which was like a studio apartment, well, a giant room) to one of my friends from high school for the landlord after maybe 4 months of having the place to myself, and even then it was pretty much entirely my house, though he also set up a DJ station for himself in the basement since he threw raves (not in the house), and had his girlfriend over, but he kept quiet, and he wasn't a grad student, but the landlord had a strong belief in my judgement — again, a miraculous thing.

I also grew out a full beard (except a really small patch probably from a lifetime of topical eczema creams, as my pediatrician told me was happening in high school or college) and full mustache in those first months I lived in that May St. house, based on some intuition, that I shaved on December 15th, 2017 (since it was the day my best friend [visited me](https://www.facebook.com/share/p/c7m83bHR5v1mP4p4/) at that house and encouraged me to shave it; the fact that we went to the friend's rave that day, who would later move in with me, was also a coincidence) some months before Aetna cut me off from the prescription to Dupilumab, but it was the first time I ever grew out my facial hair. [Here's a picture with my family at that house from my 22nd birthday](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2d1d366e-14bd-49cd-9a58-dca108e9a144), not too long after I started to grow it out.

I was working really hard in that house, developing my long-term memory research ideas and implementing the code for it there, meditating every day while practicing strict dietary (Paleo) disciplines, while working on campus taking full semesters of grad-level classes, and at the University of Rochester's Medical Center, building neural models to predict the progression of Parkinson's disease, and that house is where I started to get my idea for how stochasticity in the universe's quantum mechanics could explain a mechanism for "God" or some intelligent power in nature, hypothetically.

I was sleeping in one of the second bedrooms, when, on a rare occasion, my housemate friend and his girlfriend woke me climbing up the stairs. Somehow I had a sudden realization, near around 3 AM or whatever time it was in that night, that the universe's particles might be random, and therefore can be shifted by slight standard deviations by an intelligence — like the biological kind (or modeled by the artificial kind) — in such a way that still respects the known laws of physics and yet permits the possibility of an intelligent nature, that can modulate how those particles are sampled with respect to the sampling distributions.

In that house, somewhat before, and thereafter (continuing for years, mostly without pause), I was practicing many disciplines, including meditation, Paleo diet, and ascetic disciplines. I learned the Transcendental Meditation (TM) technique from an instructor, while living there. The instructor I learned from through the TM program was trained directly by the creator/translator of the technique, Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, the guru/yogi the Beatles infamously learned their meditation practice from. I experienced the subtle sinking/melting of my state of consciousness, including visceral physiological sensations, perhaps what some people have observed/called as "Kundalini," that I hadn't heard of yet and came to from Googling my physical sensations, that felt as though they were a movement in my esophagus, back, and trachea, incredibly visceral and physical. The meditation brought my consciousness to a sublime state and alleviated my social anxiety.

It was in that house when Aetna cut me off from Dupilumab and my hair started falling out.

After that house, I moved in with my mom to our apartment, where I came up with my [MHDPA innovation paper](https://www.overleaf.com/read/qgmmzgsrctmg#6cd1b9) (the method underlying ChatGPT) in 2018, and it was in the middle of wrapping up that that I was hospitalized. It was actually in the first hospitalization, at RGH, where I ran the successful experiments for that paper, since the hospital staff had allowed my mom to bring in my laptop. It was in the second hospital, at the University of Rochester’s Strong Hospital, where I described relational reasoning to my brother-in-law and showed that paper to my fellow inpatient, Lily (temporarily name-changed, while I’m still writing this).

### Psychiatrists at the University of Rochester's Strong Hospital

I got hospitalized that second time at the University of Rochester's Strong Hospital.

I'm 5'5" 110lb.

I had a prescription for benzos before, but for social anxiety, in which I took $\frac{1}{4}$ to $\frac{1}{2}$ of a milligram before, during the time when I took them at all, spacing out dosages usually by at least two weeks, and that had side effects.

I had to stay there for a month and they forced me to take 48x that dosage reduced later to 12x that dosage, over the course of 3 times per day, every day. Think about that. $\frac{1}{4}$ to $\frac{1}{2}$ of a milligram, once every two weeks at most, had side effects. $48\text{x}$ $-$ $12\text{x}$ that dosage, but every day.

Accounting for dosage *and* rate, that’s a minimum $336\text{x}$ $-$ $84\text{x}$ &nbsp; to &nbsp; $672\text{x}$ $-$ $168\text{x}$ increase.

For the first three or so weeks, I was high. Then the fog rolled in. The chemical waterboarding was taking effect.

([This link opens to a video with a different medical philosophy. It's worth clicking on, no matter one's skepticisms or feelings about the standard systems.](https://youtu.be/CFtsHf1lVI4?si=c7HOzpchsB2NeP1-))

I was also on antipsychotics, starting from RGH, but the remainder of this book will not be a dissection of antipsychotics, since the benzos were added on top of them, making the judgement of their efficacy compared to the damage from benzos hard to disentangle. The rest of this will be about the experience that was most-plausibly caused by the benzos. 

### Benzodiazepine ("benzos") mechanism of action

This diagram is an original understanding of the  computational neuron with a differentiable analog implemented <a href="https://github.com/slerman12/UnifiedMLold2/tree/master/Blocks/Architectures/LermanBlocks/BioNeuron">here</a>. 

Here is a [video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1i5hS2iDVuo24PnGicvn5dIZYXUzDfPAl/view?usp=share_link) I made on the topic.

#

Let's begin a simplified explanation of the brain's neuron. Neurons are cells that are connected to one each other by dendrites and axons that pass chemical messengers from one neuron to downstream neurons. The two most common chemical messengers in the brain are the excitatory neurotransmitter Glutamate and the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA. Excitatory means they cause the next neuron to also release their neurotransmitters ("fire"). Inhibitory means they lower the voltage activity of the next neuron such that the next neuron is subdued. GABA is the mechanism of action of alcohol. People think alcohol is "disinhibitory," that it "disinhibits" them, but the reality is alcohol is actually inhibitory. It confuses GABA receptors into activating, causing an inhibition of that neuron and all the neurons in your brain. It's a system-wide drug that indiscriminately simulates GABA throughout every part of your brain, from the Occipital lobe, where your eyes see (in the back of your head), to the frontal lobe, where your brain thinks it thinks.

Benzos are GABA agonists, like alcohol. That means they simulate GABA or enhance GABA receptor function. In response, the brain downregulates GABA production and receptor sensitivity universally across the brain, universally, from the parts that are understood to the parts that almost entirely aren't, including some of the most important regions of intelligence whose healthy metric level of functioning is extremely hard to measure behaviorally, clinically, and longitudinally across variants of factors, and necessary for quality living, e.g., the hippocampus responsible for long-term memory. Alcohol does this too, but humans have provably evolved natural mechanisms of recovering from small doses of alcohol thanks to fermented fruit existing in nature. Benzos seem like a Godsend, a Panacea, especially since you're less likely to feel a headache the next day from them for the same effect, but the evidence isn't strong enough to support they're better than alcohol. From what I've gathered, benzos are worse. Since it's somewhat relevant, [here](https://youtu.be/TEKgesBVTJ0?si=OtXQYMZgVd3Qu36M) is a video I made on evolutionary algorithms in deep learning.

Nobody understands this mechanism. To understand this mechanism, you'd have to solve all of neurology and artificial intelligence, and psychiatrists definitely haven't. Benzos are a floodbath of GABA, and your brain responds to those GABA bursts by "downregulation," even long, long after cessation.

### Hospitalization

Lily was 24 when we met, a year older than me. While I was there, we played Guitar Hero with our friend Hudson and another guy. I got her to do yoga, since I was still doing all my yoga and meditation regimen there.

My mom was even bringing in my Paleo-diet food as a substitute for the food the hospital had, that I shared with Lily as well since she really liked that food, and the hospital had no real substitute for the processed drug they served out. I really did not need to be inoculated against my will with floodbaths of benzos for the next >6 months. In combination with meditation and yoga, I only include this to make the point that my health practices were far too healthy for psychiatrists to be dictating what potent psychoactive drugs go into my body. If anything, I should've been dictating their professional practices.

While she and I were in the hospital, our third companion was Hudson. When I was being discharged, he wrote me this long letter that included the line, "I hope you remember me when your an Icon of the world." He was electroshocked weekly during my stay there. For depression. Electrovolts of lightning in an electric chair for his depression. 

<p align="center">
<img width="300" alt="Screenshot 2024-03-12 at 8 10 34 PM" src="https://github.com/slerman12/Detective-Sam/assets/9126603/d5414cba-2012-42f9-b516-f06dd8760cad">
</p>

It's amazing he could write at all after the electrocution they put him through. I guess pharmaceuticals didn't seem sufficiently crucial to the core of his depression that they believed hooking him up to a car battery would make more sense.

Meanwhile, little did I know — and actually quite a lot since I made the case quite articulately — I was being brain damaged and chemically waterboarded.

My friend Jeremiah, someone so kind it's not even funny, went through something different while he was there. He told me the university-hospital police officers held him down and choked him for trying to escape, tackled and pinned him down violently on pavement, and that his medications once caused him to have a seizure. Having undergone physical assaults from the university-hospital police myself, once in the grass outside, and burned alive in the downregulation nightmare, I can say it’s unpleasant. 

Those events are listed in the reverse chronological order by the way, combative effort to escape only appearing in later hospitalization that followed and probably was contributed to from this one with the multi-year benzo nightmare.

Finally, Mobi, this guy I met there at a different hospitalization. He actually braided Lily's hair, I later found out. When you have people in there with you, it's actually palatable. But when you're alone, kept hostage, for prolonged periods, against your will, under constant overwatch and coercion, it's not the same story. Mobi was 16, also prescribed benzos like I was, but he was there much longer. Years, in and out. This is the part I can't even believe as I write: he was in there for drug problems and addiction. No wonder: they were feeding him the most potent addictive chemicals on the known planet by force. Yes: to be clear: they'd been giving him benzos for 2 years at that point, on and perhaps-sporadically-off, from the age of 14. Acclimating to benzos, yes, your brain is going to feel deprived of GABA and you will want drugs. A 16-year-old drug addict who they kept institutionalizing periodically and made take benzos.

And he was intelligent and respectful and well mannered. There is no way he should've been in the hospital. He could've been a revolution leader or some shit.

The next part of the story conveys some of my trauma, and it's goun be hard to write about.

### My trauma

They didn't ask about what happened to me. They just wanted to treat the "catatonia," which, ironically, wasn't what it was, didn't involve immobolization (delusional-adherence to threats in a psychotic state aren't the same as catatonia), and I was conscious. The previous trauma was too recent for me to explain it to them. It took the last 5 years to process into a form that I could write, not written here either.

The first psychiatrist was scheduling to wean me off from the benzos before my discharge. I quickly told him I was worried about the benzos, and he seemed prompted to withdraw me as fast as safely possible. He assured me it'd be before the discharge.

The second psychiatrist changed the schedule some time after that. She came in to replace him, and he wanted to wean me off still, and knew how concerned I was, and she was utterly insistent that the outpatient doctor would wean me off. That means the psychiatrist after the hospitalization.

He didn't. I don't remember his name either, but not because of being high — at that point, I was in severe cognitive decline, and the euphoria was turning into grey cloud and fog, excruciating anxiety and fear, and terror. 

In the first month with him, I told him about all of these symptoms, and tried to relay the agony. He didn't care. He thought the benzos would help. He argued they could be safely taken for years.

At no point did he specify a tapering schedule, despite me practically begging him.

In the second month, I told him I was brain damaged. He wanted to increase the dose. I begged him to taper, and he thought if I was having all those negative symptoms, that the dose must've been too low. He wanted to increase the dose.

I should've weaned myself off. I knew he was wrong, but inside I didn't have the conviction (notably, because of the drug) to wean myself off — and I write this with the same truth value as "the Holocaust was bad": I should've.

The brain's writing mechanisms revolve around memory. During that period, I had no memory. My linguistics have nothing vivid to center on because everything from that period was grey.

Having your brain's GABA downregulated is like living actively in a warzone. It is, without exaggeration, a form of legalized torture. Coerced benzo usage is neurochemical waterboarding. Former addicts of heroin or cocaine who were on benzos have described them as worse than heroin or cocaine. Not long ago, lobotomies and conversion therapies were standard practice. History will recognize the barbarism of today's psychiatric practices, especially around coercion, in particular of benzos.

1. My doctor wanted to increase the dose, not realizing that that would start a perpetual race against the brain's downregulation mechanisms. His clinical authority meant more to him than my agony.
2. While systemic issues don't excuse an individual clinician's disbelief in / coercion of a patient, the profits of big pharma companies in the $3 billion benzo drug market add to the disarray of confusion in the practice and principle of clinicians, and, [suspiciously, there are contradictions in recent studies from previous decades, on the same drugs. "the Medical Research Council (MRC) in Britain agreed in 1982 that there should be large-scale studies to examine the long-term impact of benzodiazepines after research by a leading psychiatrist showed brain shrinkage in some patients similar to the effects of long-term alcohol abuse." The study was buried: "The only problem with the MRC's response to such warnings about benzos? It appears to have sat for thirty years on the very documents that warned about the risks of brain shrinkage in patients taking them. Moreover, the MRC appears to have marked the documents 'closed until 2014,' despite their obvious importance to public health. [...] 'Members of Parliament and lawyers,' she continues, 'described the recently revealed documents as a scandal, and predicted they could lead the way to a class action costing millions.'"](https://www.psychologytoday.com/intl/blog/side-effects/201011/pharmaceutical-scandal-in-britain-sheds-disturbing-new-light)
3. What could've caused three psychiatrists, with zero consensus between each other, and zero consent from the patient, to cause so much damage? I suspect the >6 months of inconsistent psychiatrist and doctor plans were due to the self-reinforcing biases clinicians (in the general sense) can create in themselves as they change a patient's personality through chemical interventions. My personality started very charming and cheerful due to the benzos, at which point they still planned to wean me off within the hospital. Then fear and anxiety rose due to increasing downregulation. As those induced neurological changes "doctored" my perception and psyche, my believability lessened (due solely to reduced neurological function, not any fundamental behavioral change aside from mental impairment, and no catatonia, or mania, or delusion), and each changing shift of psychiatrists extended the asserted duration of the coerced prescription of the previous, changing the plans of the previous psychiatrists, culminating with the outpatient doctor only willing to increase, with no taper schedule on the planned horizon. Doctors are aggressively playing Gods, and have no understanding of the severe bias that their own interventions produce in their own or each other's clinical decision-making. Measurement-bias is a known problem in science. Detection can result in a change in the state of the physical system (or organism or body) being detected. In medicine, this problem is less widely understood since the subjects being observed, detected, analyzed, judged, and changed are people.
4. This reminds me, that outpatient doctor commented on my bald head. He wouldn't believe me that the hair loss was induced. $\color{#d08370}\text{He}$ $\color{#d08370}\text{interrogated,}$ $\color{#d08370}\text{rather}$ $\color{#d08370}\text{repeatedly,}$ $\color{#d08370}\text{even}$ $\color{#d08370}\text{after}$ $\color{#d08370}\text{I}$ $\color{#d08370}\text{answered,}$ $\color{#d08370}\text{whether}$ $\color{#d08370}\text{I}$ $\color{#d08370}\text{had}$ $\color{#d08370}\text{pulled}$ $\color{#d08370}\text{the}$ $\color{#d08370}\text{hair}$ $\color{#d08370}\text{out}$ $\color{#d08370}\text{myself}$.

I was in severe pain and agony by the second month with that doctor. I communicated that to him in every session. He responded with only authority, no reasoning, and no sensitivity. He made no consideration to the possibility that I was right or he was wrong. I wasn't able to recall sentimental memories or easily do basic math, my brain was grey, my cognition was worsening each month, and the anxiety that appeared on me without stop was torture. I also had physical symptoms like severe tinnitus. As these months progressed, my facial structure changed, wrinkled and lost youth. What I suffered was physiologically brain damage. My cognition and perception deteriorated severely, and tinnitus, mouth dryness, and wrinkles added to the mounting evidence of damages happening not just to my psyche, but to my brain and body. With benzos, that damage can be permanent. If I'm speaking most-accurately, the benzo trauma wasn't just brain or body damage, but neurochemical waterboarding. At after the 6 month point, I gradually reduced the dose to wean off. The agony persisted afterwards (still chemical waterboarding, but after I weaned off, severe downregulation rather than the combined severe downregulation and psychoactivity of the chemical, "hungover" chemical waterboarding).

Starting some months (maybe 4th month) into taking the benzos, before I began weaning, I was laying on the couch, immobilized, shaking with excruciating agony. No sleep, no escape. No exit, just PhD work (yes, and not easily) and torture. Skin dry, teeth calcifying (at a dental cleaning appointment, the hygienist diagnosed it as calcification and the attributed cause as dry mouth due to benzodiazepines), no memory, no linguistic expression, cognition completely grey and burning. All color gone, all imagery, all imagination, only pain, perpetual pain and fear. Terror. Terror terror terror. I remember one day trying to do $4*7$, and not being able to. They say the only thing to fear is fear itself: GABA downregulation is fear itself. The experience is like being in a warzone. It's like burning alive — without stop — more than a year, torture. The neurochemical experience is literally what you go through if you're in a warzone, and being chased by a predator, while in the middle of having a seizure: hellfire, indescribable pain. I remember staying up nights shaking, trying CBD oil or L-theanine (latter didn't work — the CBD oil slightly helped) to try to sleep and just shaking, electricity swarming through me, my face curled, deformed as I tensed and agonized all night unless I got some sleep if I was lucky and then waking up feeling like that, again, for the rest of the day, every day, for months like this. These symptoms started around maybe the 4 month mark while I was still on the benzos and persisted for more than a year. I've read former cocaine and heroin addicts say the withdrawal of long-term benzo addiction is worse than for cocaine or heroin. I'm sure there isn't an experience on this Earth that is worse, humanly or cosmically possible (a year without sleep, non-stop neurochemical fire, not sure that's even imaginable). 

The nightmare I mentioned earlier was a waking one for a year.

You know, the way I learned about the calcification was because chunks of what I thought were tooth were falling out. Just chunks of tooth-like pieces from my mouth. So I went to the dental hygienist and she said it was de-calcification. This was already when I was starting to recover to some extent, when I was already on the steak-only diet. To reiterate: it started *de*-calcifying at that point. The calcification built up a lot during the 6 months I was on benzos. That was her diagnosis: calcification due to dry mouth from benzos.

The steak-diet saved my ass.

The trauma I went through during my psychosis (which the psychiatrists didn't even know about) doesn't compare to the year of benzo neurochemical torture.

The experience of losing my hair has cost me relationships and worsened my social anxiety, and the benzo-brain damage and torture leaves me with PTSD.

Many Jews, including my grandpa, his sister, and his mom (my grandpa's father was mandatorily fighting in the warfront), fled the Nazis to Muslim nations, like Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan for refuge. My grandpa's family evacuated from Ukraine to Kazakhstan. After the temporary evacuation, he returned to Ukraine, where he met my grandma, they married, and he was later assigned to a job in Samarkand, Uzbekistan by the Soviet Union to work at a leather plant/factory producing leather from sheepskin fur. He was a leather technology engineer there. Samarkand is where my mom and eventually my sister and I were born. My mom and her brother were born and grew up in Samarkand and lived there past the ages of 40 until we all immigrated, on separate occasions since my mom had to do a separate interview with the American Embassy in Moscow to convince them. One proof of subjugation she had is that, by custom, Jews weren’t allowed into PhD programs in Uzbekistan. She had a Master’s degree in music theory, was a great student, and taught at a music college, but wasn’t allowed to do a PhD for that reason. Jews weren’t customarily allowed to hold higher offices in Uzbekistan, generally. When she did the interview, she brought her two kids, my sister and I, to Moscow. I was 3 years old. My Aunt’s brother’s family in Moscow let her hold us at their house while my mom waited at the Embassy, all day, without food, and went through the interview. The interviewer remarked that her form said she had kids. "Where are they?" She spent the full day in that embassy, waiting, without food. “How could I bring them?" she said. "My son is 3 years old. I can't put him through waiting here all day without food.” And the interviewer laughed and answered with appreciation, “No, you’re absolutely right. Usually moms bring their kids here in order to show them to us to gain belief or sympathy. They think by proving they have kids, they will get accepted.”

In America, my mom found a low-paying piano teaching job, and got an associate's degree at a community college in Computer Information Systems, since that was how she hoped to earn more money to support us. Later, she worked two jobs, as a piano teacher giving individual lessons for a piano studio and a part-time computer tutor at MCC in two different labs. She actually taught me how to program — specifically, object-oriented programming — when I started my undergrad at the University of Rochester. She helped me do well enough in that class, since I couldn't learn anything from the professor. I double majored in Computer Science and Mathematics. If it weren't for my mom's love, I would not have gotten into a doctoral program.

Well, thanks to her and my doctoral advisor, Henry.

Prior to that, after my family moved to the United States as Jewish refugees from the Republic of Uzbekistan when I was 3ish/4, I faced many challenges: living in a small apartment with a single mother, poverty, learning English, assimilating to American culture, and processing the loss of my grandparents. On one hand, I understand the burden of poverty and the struggle of being an immigrant. Academically, this means being passionate and dedicated; socially, being open minded towards people of different backgrounds. On the other hand, however, I consider myself to be privileged. My mother is the embodiment of compassion. Material wealth is worthless without meaningful relationships, and disadvantaged conditions are made rich with love. 

My mother raised me to understand the importance of looking at the world from another's perspective. As one cannot understand others without first understanding oneself, I have always sought to explore my mind. To me, artificial intelligence is an extension of the rigorous self-analysis I've been doing my entire life. Designing an intelligent machine not only requires an understanding of mathematics and computer science, but also of humanity and of motivation — and this understanding is afforded to me by the empathy I have for others and by the exploration of my consciousness. Not only can I connect the study of intelligence to my lifelong curiosity around the mystery of life, but I can realize these great technologies to affect the world in profoundly positive and meaningful ways. My aspiration in my career was to solve general intelligence, and have a voice in ensuring that it is used in the interest of every living being.	
 
I joined the Center for Health and Technology a year into their efforts to model Parkinson’s disease (PD) progression. It was an honor to be entrusted with leading the PPMI Data Challenge project, a high-profile data contest hosted by the Michael J. Fox Foundation, which asked, "What factors at baseline predict clinical progression?"

Charles was my first advisor there.

Henry recommended me to the position at the Med Center to do disease modeling, while I was still an undergrad, predating all of the medical trauma, specifically, and entirely by coincidence, doing research in neurodegenerative disease modeling. “Neurodegenerative” means when the brain degenerates, for example, by chemical floodbaths of GABA from benzodiazepines and severe downregulation.

While I was working and researching under Charles, I had built a [disease prognostication machine learning model](https://github.com/slerman12/DiseaseModeling) that won top-three in the Michael J. Fox Foundation for Parkinson's Research PPMI  contest, and came up with the idea of building a web app for the prognostication to give clinicians a clean, elegant interface. I had to argue a bit, and convince them, and then they let me, and, as a PhD student (about in my second year, already in benzo withdrawal), I even presented it at a conference in DC in front of reknowned researchers in the Parkinson's research field. Despite that being my idea and my [prototype](https://github.com/slerman12/DiseaseModelingWebApp), they liked it so much that they hired a web development team to build one, and since have never given me credit. Charles also said they were going to patent it and contacted a patent lawyer, and since have given me no information or updates about that either.

Perhaps Charles or some of his colleagues may find the above diagram (["5 Computational Neurons"](#benzodiazepine-benzos-mechanism-of-action)) valuable in their work, this time ideally with credit attribution.

</p>

The work I did at the Med Center earned me a recommendation back to Henry Kautz, [as well as a news article](https://www.rochester.edu/newscenter/undergraduate-students-place-in-top-three-in-parkinsons-disease-data-science-contest-228912/). On top of that, I built [a sleek website API for Twitter GNIP data mining](https://github.com/slerman12/TwitterDataCollector) for Henry's research group, and was praised by other affiliates of his that he recommended me to, at [Bryx emergency response](https://bryx.com). As a result, combined with my eclectic interests, he accepted me into his PhD group as a doctoral student.

After the hospitalization, it was from that couch during a video call with my advisor (who was in DC) during the peak-period of the withdrawal  that I described that biologically-inspired neuron architecture [above](#benzodiazepine-benzos-mechanism-of-action), with the specifics in the [video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1i5hS2iDVuo24PnGicvn5dIZYXUzDfPAl/view?usp=share_link) comparing it to the LSTM architecture.

I remember having video calls from my office with him too, teaching him "sequence-to-sequence attention" (even as I was working on innovations to MHDPA, now suffering due to grad-level classes, TAship, impending area exam, and not to mention brain damage) and being in a state of misery that I couldn't convey.

I passed my area exam in my second PhD year, "with flying colors" according to Henry.

My advisor, Henry, didn't think deep learning was a fad, and had a sense of intuition about ideas like the biologically-inspired neuron in the diagram [above](#benzodiazepine-benzos-mechanism-of-action) though not always of involved ideas, like the use of attention mechanisms (e.g., MHDPA). My next advisor, my machine vision professor from my first year Chenliang Xu, technically wasn't in the room during the area exam, because he was answering the Skype call from China. He's the only person in the meeting who asked elaboration on how I planned to do "relational representations" for vision with image features from a CNN, since he didn't know what MHDPA was (neither did my NLP professor, who also did and oversaw work in deep learning, from the semester just before my hospitalization) and I went back to slide 11 and re-described MHDPA to all of them again, and the fact that Chenliang was the only one of them who showed interest in the method that most revolutionized the next years of their fields, and not only my particularly vibrant presentation that day (for well rehearsed and well planned reasons, involving some reuptake of benzos again, for being able to function at all and apparently "flying color," though that's not how Henry meant it), is meaningful since he became my later advisor.  

[My slides for that area exam were quite colorful](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1LK0urIs8yu_e7HyZ-VQoDJUiGpPeTPEUgfhjK5Kw_7w/edit?usp=sharing), but that's also not how Henry meant it (see slide 11 for the description of MHDPA).

I rehearsed that area exam in front of my mom and uncle for a week every day before the area exam. At the area exam, I presented word by word as I rehearsed. My mom and uncle knew I was going to take a high dose of benzos that day. That was the plan. I even rehearsed one day in front of them at a smaller dose. They also knew. That was also the plan. (And, by the way, benzos were originally prescribed to me for social anxiety). That was one of two occasions during my greater-than-yearlong benzo withdrawal that I had to take any doses of benzos again to do something required of me, and couldn't find another way to do what it was, the other being the poster presentation for the Medical Center, since that also involved cognitive performance in front of people. 

My uncle was worried I wouldn't pass, and we all celebrated joyfully that I did. My best friend was texting me at the time and was proud. He knew about the benzo trauma, though even he didn't know about those preceding details that led to the hospitalization at RGH. Nobody even in my family did. Definitely Henry didn't.

Henry got an offer to lead the AI division at the National Science Foundation in DC, which is an extremely prestigious role. So he accepted and I had to find a new advisor. He directed me to switch to Chenliang Xu, who gave me an ultimatum about joining. I worked under him for 3 years, at which time he deserted.

### Chenliang Xu

<p align="center">

</p>

For context, Henry's average paper count was 1 - 3 across the PhD student's full tenure. At the time of asking to join Chenliang's lab, the end of my 3rd year (near the end of Spring semester, 2020, before the university began Covid lockdowns), I had no publications.

Chenliang gave me an ultimatum: Submit a top-venue paper by end of summer, without pay, or no acceptance. Had I failed to do that, I wouldn't have an advisor or pay, and most likely, would've been terminated.

I presented Semantic Segmentation with MHDPA applied to image features. That, applied to a Computer Vision domain specifically, would've been the first Vision Transformer, but there wasn't enough time to build and benchmark that with the pressure and deadline from Chenliang.

I had to work at the Med Center concurrently for funding, since Chenliang wasn't paying me, and had to spend at least a month giving my nights and weekends to achieving his ultimatum by the summer, 2020 NeurIPS deadline.

He also said I'd have to come in every day to do that work in his lab, which I ended up not having to do due to the lockdowns.

He accepted me into his lab when I succesfully delivered that [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.08601), my first published paper, "Taylor-CAM," ended up getting positive reviews, rejected, and then later accepted at ICCV, a top-venue conference (in AI, conferences are bigger than journals, and that was quite a feat for a few months, in a brand new research area, switching fields from "medical prognostication" to "state of the art computer vision").

It's ironic also that when he announced his desertion (due to not having published enough papers in that time frame), on ****07/24/2023****, 3 years later, I was in the middle of a paper review with positive reviews, [that got accepted](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41524-023-01164-8).

During those 3 years, for the most part, Chenliang didn't directly fund me. At first I worked at the Medical Center. Then, he put me on a Mechanical Engineering lab, where I didn't work *instead of* his ordinary group requirements, but entirely on top of. In fact, none of the 3 committee members who the deciding Judge, and CS department Chair Michael Scott, attributed to my termination in my 6th year, addressed or acknowledged that I was working for and receiving funding for my work from the Mechanical Engineering department at the time, not from CS (meaning, the people who'll later terminate me, weren't the people giving me my paid work, technically at nearly any point; even prior to Chenliang was Med Center and an NSF grant that I applied for).

Meanwhile, under Niaz, in the Mechanical Engineering department, specifically Materials Science, I produced exactly the paper rate that she wanted, and through really hard work to make sure the ideas, experiments, grant-writing, data, and programming were all really high quality ([here is the GitHub repo I built for us](https://github.com/AGI-init/XRDs)).

Last-minute, and with almost no notice, and without Niaz's approval, Chenliang wanted to allocate that Mechanical Engineering-work funding to someone else, due to me not providing enough publications in his Computer Vision group. Yes that funding that I helped earn — literally — through the programming and grant ideas and grant writing and grant diagrams, definitively leading and exceptionally implementing the AI side of the work on which all of the models were built and experiments were run and plotted, and with support and appreciation from the rest of the group as I taught them deep learning in each of our meetings every week, which included Chenliang. He'd given me no prior warning or indication of dissatisfaction. Quite the opposite actually.

As Niaz said, "I don't know what he was thinking."

### Aside

#### I didn't mention fingernails (fingernails regrowth)

In Moscow, during the Nazi attack, my grandma and her older sister, while they were little girls (my grandma was 13 and my great Aunt Tsilia was 18), threw fire bombs off the roof of their dad's and step mother's house, that the Nazi planes were dropping fire bombs on, meant to burn the houses. Their dad was fighting in the war front; their mother had died when my grandma was 5 and her sister was 10, from typhus, a very bad infectious disease. Their step mother was sick with tuberculosis; and their little younger step-brother Yura was too young to help with throwing the fire bombs. [Note: This description came from memory. A primary source description is quoted below. I'll add a link to the rest of the interview later.].

> ### $\Huge &#8220;$
> Moscow was bombed every day, sometimes multiple times a day. 500 airplanes bombed the city in one day. Not only bombs, but also a lot of lighters were thrown from the airplanes. The alarm of the air raid required everyone to step down to the underground [bomb shelters], and I went there too. But if the air raid came at the time of our work shift, we, all working at the armory children [factory of defense], climbed on the roof. Our responsibility was to take the hot lighters and throw them off the roof, to prevent a fire.

> &ensp;&ensp; - Translated by my mom from an interview with my grandma in a draft of an essay my mom wrote for MCC, in October, 2000. Brackets denote additions by my mom.
>
> TO DO: Add the whole interview.
>
> Also, the voice interview with my grandpa.

My grandma was about 24 when she and my grandpa arrived to Samarkand.  She was a German language teacher, before my uncle was born. She didn't know German, but she knew Yiddish, so she accepted the job, since Yiddish is close to German. Later, she was a teacher of Russian language and Russian literature, separate fields. Later, she was an academic principle of a school and continued teaching.

My grandma had long grey hair, down to almost her waist or hips. She curled it up behind her head with hair pins, like in a bun but prettier.

She told me when we were sitting in the backseat of the car, perhaps when we were going with my mom and grandpa to the pool at JCC, that I had her fingernails, perhaps unusual. I got a girlfriend temporarily in 2016, the semester that my grandma died, who remarked on my cuticles. I didn't know what those were, but apparently I didn't cut them. Also an unusual remark, at an important juncture involving my grandma, that I remember. 

Anyway, in addition to losing all of my hair — head, eyebrows, and eyelashes — due to the Dupilumab cessation, I also lost my fingernails in functionality in 2018, also unambiguously due to the Dupilumab cessation. They regrew, healthily functional enough, after being purple, and bendy like putty, for a really long time, maybe into 2019. 

#### How my grandma got dementia

My grandma was prescribed a cocktail of neuroactive drugs before she had dementia. Seroquel, Lyrica, Xanax, and the list goes on. She didn't have any of the conditions those medications are primarily supposed to treat (Seroquel is an antipsychotic, Lyrica is an antiepileptic, Xanax is a benzo), and every time she developed a new symptom from one, they prescribed yet another. She developed dementia when I was still in high school. She lived with dementia from then to my Junior year of college, the year my grandpa died, 2016, when she died as well.

She shortly outlived my grandpa, and died the same year as him three days before his April 16 birthday, on April 13, 2016.

#### How my grandpa died

My grandpa survived two heart attacks previously, one in Uzbekistan and one in America. He was having trouble breathing and my mom took him to his primary care doctor, who diagnosed him with congestive heart failure and prescribed pills. About a month and a week later, he was still having trouble breathing and my mom took him to the hospital. According to the blood analysis in the hospital, apparently he had a third heart attack, about a week before. His heart doctor came to the hospital and recommended a stent be put in his heart's main artery. The surgery was an angiogram, and uses a dye that is bad for the kidneys. The heart doctor recommended it strongly; the primary care physician wanted to discharge him and send him for rehabilitation already, without the surgery. The heart doctor told my mom that without the surgery, his heart would only get worse, and that he'd only have heart attacks and eventually die. So my mom chose to go with the surgery. The surgeon wasn't able to do the surgery for the main artery, because it was completely blocked, and so he put in stents into the little arteries that were narrow but weren't the cause of the congestive heart failure. My grandpa's kidneys got worse after the surgery that used the dye that was bad for kidneys and he couldn't walk at all anymore. He couldn't stand up on his feet. For some reason, not knowing what to do with him, they discharged him and sent him to the Jewish home for rehabilitation, for physical therapy to help with his kidneys.

They also scheduled a follow-up appointment with his heart doctor in that heart doctor's private office in a different location.

My grandpa was a self-reliant man, but the stress of moving from the Jewish home to that heart doctor's office was extreme. My mom was there, and it was a big ordeal just to help him stand amid the kidney problems that were causing him difficulty moving. He died that night of heart failure, after that grueling trial to get to his heart doctor's office (they used an elevating machine that lifted him up from his bed), and my mom witnessed how big a toll that transfer of locations took. That doctor had even asked, "Why was he discharged from the hospital? In this condition, he should be in the hospital." 

My grandpa's heart failed, at least sooner than it would've, due to the trial of getting him to the bus from the Jewish home that took him to his heart doctor. His official death date is the night (morning) after that appointment, January 22, 2016.

In Uzbekistan, primary physicians visited patients, even to their homes, as a standard part of their healthcare system. That wasn't the case with cardiologists, but American healthcare should try to go a step up from Uzbek healthcare, not a step down.

#### Another old Jew helps transition the times

My grandpa's death in 2016 preceded another old Jewish Bernie Sanders-type role model (whose name either rhymes with, or is, "Yury") rising to my attention: none other than Bernie Sanders himself, the first person I was old enough to vote for in our democracy. 

I wanted to donate to Bernie early in his campaign, before he was a household name. My mom was worried his emails might've been spam because my description sounded too good to be true for a politician. And I suppose it was, since he's not exactly a politician and more about [governance](https://github.com/animal-tree/Governance/blob/main/Does-Nature-Endorse%3F.md) and specific policies (such as Medicare For All). That girlfriend who remarked on my cuticles, and I, actually bonded over our shared fanning over Bernie Sanders. 

But I bring him up now because the following chapters are going to point to some serious problems more specifically, and address some specific reforms, ones that aren't redundant to the ones Bernie Sanders has already done a damn good job of popularizing into a skeptical mainstream audience, especially in the purported views of Democratic politicians since his surgency. How do I transition into this... Well...

Speaking of the elderly...

#### Geriatric unit hospitalization

> [!WARNING]
> In December, 2020, I had another hospitalization, my last hospitalization, the geriatric unit (elderly facility) one.
>
> The ambulance drove me to the hospital, where first, they brought me to a lobby.
>
> In the lobby, the nurse pulled me behind a curtain and made me change clothes, and I didn't want to (was slightly reluctant), but she told me I had to. Then she sat me in a wheelchair. A nurse pushed it forward, it ran over my big toe, and I screamed out specifically that my toe was run over. The nurse kept rolling me off, as she and the other nurses all ignored my screaming, in what, surprisingly, didn't break my toe. 
>
> Next, they brought me to an open area filled with other patients, and told me I'd be transferred later that day.
>
> Each day I was told I’d be transferred that day or the next day. I had to sleep there in a chair for a week. The dungeon-like area was full, in every square foot of the open areas, with other patients, who slept on mattresses or also in chairs. The clinicians seemed to forget about me and still had no particular reason for the imprisonment.
>
> Besides the clothes they’d made me change into, I was given only highly processed foods to eat, foods that usually cause eczema, drugs including benzos, and periodic clinical visits from clinicians who could've been mistaken for military interrogators. Clinical authorities.
>
> None of them were consistent or attendant enough to see this, but I was in an increasingly sensitive state, as I was coerced through all of this, knowing-unjustly, and with no normal sleep for a week.
>
> After a week of sleeping in a chair, they transferred me to the geriatric unit (a facility for the elderly) on a different floor, their regular psychiatric units being full.
>
> Finally, they specified a reason for why they were holding me. Apparently my mom said I wasn't eating enough, which she later denied saying. Ironically, I was eating a lot. Usually 5 organic steaks and a salmon every day, about half of my income. I was lectured pretty heavily by a fat woman specialist about how carbs are a necessary part of a healthy diet. That was Winter, 2020/2021, perhaps just before diets like the keto diet gained scientific support, or maybe already after. During that hospitalization, chunks of my hair fell out. The rapid timing was extremely coincidental, so maybe the onset of the hair loss was independent to the hospitalization, or maybe a synchronicity, but most likely exacerbated, because I thought I was in Hell.
> 
> The anxiety was so extreme that my eczema became itchy just from that, if not the food. I ate all of their garbage food. I made special requests, but the diet they provided wasn't more than what you'd expect from hospital food, and always came with an abundance of chocolate Ensures, enough to probably buy a steak honestly.
> 
> Due to Covid, my family wasn’t allowed to visit me.
>
> Of all the hospitalizations (excluding aftermath, e.g., benzos trauma), the most traumatic was the geriatric unit one. And not because they ran over my toe with the wheelchair that I was in and ignored my pained screams, nor the enclosed-dungeon area where they made me sleep in a chair for a week, eat stuff I was allergic too, take benzos temporarily again, and share living space amid lots of commotion and tons of people, but because of the geriatric unit they subsequently transferred me to. Old people. People I thought were sketchy. One friend, black guy I shared pudding crackers with at the window later, after, when I managed to get out of my room from the trauma of thinking I was in Hell. Other than that, coldness, Hell-setting, and, while I was still confined to my bed due to the intensity of the earlier dungeon area where they kept saying they'd transfer me to a room later that day and didn't for another week, the beam of red light shining into my window from the neighboring hospital roof, being stuck in a floor with no nature, old lady in the room next door screaming "Oh Christia! Oh Christia!" every day, only plastic and children's colors and an artificial picture painting across from my door. And I had a whole bed and bathroom to myself, but still. The nurses and staff were fine, but the environment was bad.
>
> That was the geriatric unit hospitalization, psychiatric wards were full, ran over my toe, they kept me in an open-room with other patients, and then after like a week of me sleeping in a chair, they transferred me to a geriatric unit, with me unable to leave my bed through New Year’s, once they situated me in that geriatric unit room, no visitors. 
>
> I got to spit the benzos out into my Covid mask.
>
> I think they did a Covid test before transferring me, though I don't recall one. I'm just inferring, since it was a geriatric unit (a unit for the elderly). Yes, I recall mention of a Covid test. I don't know if it was before or after the dungeon-area.
>
> To summarize:
> - My big toe was painfully run over by the nurse, and ignored, no attention paid, disregarded screaming.
> - I had to sleep in a chair in a shared open area filled with other patients for a week with only scary clinical authorities who came around occasionally to interrogate me, drugs handed to me, and with food only that I was allergic to, while in an increasingly sensitive state, and being told I'd be transferred to a room later that day or the next day.
> - I was transferred to a geriatric unit, with almost nobody my age, and an environment that lacked any nature, with only synthetic plastics, no genuine warmth, and an abundance of chocolate Ensures.
> - I was lectured about not eating enough carbs.
> - My hair was falling out into my hands and my eczema returned.
>
> Since Winter, 2020/2021, I have not had another serious or psychiatric hospitalization. There was one hospitalization half a year later, in which I was there for half a day, but they neither held me there nor believed there was any psychiatric issue. The geriatric unit hospitalization was traumatizing, but that's not the reason why I successfully avoided future imprisonments. That reason isn't specified here.

> At the end of [A Beautiful Mind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Beautiful_Mind_(film)), the nobel prizewinner with schizophrenia, John Nash, is depicted as achieving stability by taking his medications. The real John Nash objected to them, and lived pretty much his entire life unmedicated, starting from long before he came up with the work that led to his winning the Nobel Prize. While the movie's depiction is somehow extremely romantic to medical systems, it's inaccurate to the true history of how he surmounted his diagnoses. ["In Sylvia Nasar’s book with the same title, on which the film is based, it is clearly stated that Nash stopped taking medication in 1970 because of the way it blunted his intellect. The change was apparently made because the screenwriter, Akiva Goldsman, whose mother was a prominent psychologist, was worried that the film might persuade people to stop taking their medication."](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/jun/02/dont-use-john-nash-schizophrenia-a-beautiful-mind-promote-anti-psychotics) Yes, the film based on a true story might persuade people wrongly. So better fabricate it. ["in a scene [around the time of the character's Nobel nomination in 1994], Russell Crowe explicitly credits his recovery [...] to newer medication. The truth is that Nash stopped taking any medication in 1970. The line is a fabrication, and a conscious one."](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/jun/02/dont-use-john-nash-schizophrenia-a-beautiful-mind-promote-anti-psychotics)

> ["Nash described sanity as a form of conformity, and one about which he maintained a degree of ambivalence. 'So, at the present time, I seem to be thinking rationally in the style that is characteristic of scientists,' he wrote. 'However, this is not entirely a matter of joy, as if someone returned from physical disability to good physical health. One aspect of this is that rationality of thought imposes a limit on a person’s concept of his relation to the cosmos.' There can be no doubt that to talk in such terms requires both honesty and tremendous courage. The question is whether we have the courage to hear him."](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/jun/02/dont-use-john-nash-schizophrenia-a-beautiful-mind-promote-anti-psychotics)

To do: Make a diagram specifically for geriatric unit hospitalization (University of Rochester's Strong Hospital).

Chronology: Lobby wheelchair toe -> open-area chair sleeping with processed eczema-causing food, more coerced benzos, and interrogative military clinicians -> geriatric unit -> them arguing carbs were a necessary part of a healthy diet and stating that the reason for holding me in that hospitalization was that I wasn't eating enough (even as I ate all of their garbage food).

#### Warmth, nature, and organic-type foods

I didn’t eat steak, because of course they couldn’t afford it. Could you imagine if hospitals served grassfed, grass-finished organic steak? I was on a PhD student budget and spent my salary, despite savings, on mostly just steak/fish (with some Paleo leniency) and gas each month. But hospitals spend their wealth on drugs and chocolate Ensures. And that’s when my hair fell out, and my eczema started returning. That's point 2. (Glossing over the environment-setting point, nature, fresh air, hiking, camping, etc.). That last point, hidden in the parenthetical, deserves its own book, and might be getting one.

#### Schools

Let's now regress back to childhood.

Many of the problems that exist in hospitals also exist in public and private education systems. Kids are being put through concentration camps. These environments should be more like summer camps, monasteries, or Hogwarts — filled with nature and healthy food — not Nazi prisons. Literally concentration camps is what our society puts kids through, pretty much by force, as if it's some law of nature that kids must endure a coercive system by the time they're 6, and give the best hours of the day to that system until they're dead, in order to facilitate their development of wisdom and utility to other people (as opposed to stress, bullying, and hurting other people through more such endless cycles of coercive systemic brainwashings and zombie-ism).

Those environments are where we learn that some people are inferior to others, namely, students, to teachers and adults, with potentially permanent life-threatening consequences. 

#### Future hair losses

My pubic hair grew back in 2021 while doing a strict steak/salmon-only diet with some Paleo leniency — it was definitely still grown back while I was doing that diet in December, 2021 — and fell out gradually. 
- That hair grew back already in the period when Chenliang’s group was reasonably impressed with me (which never concluded, I don't think), though I was working too hard and exercising too many disciplines that alienated me from people socially. I imposed those disciplines on myself for multiple reasons, but mood, cognition, and willpower were the main benefits besides hair regrowth at that point, and I believed they were helping my social life, not hurting it, since that was my primary purpose for them, as I concurrently had to do an enormous amount of work for Chenliang, and two separate labs, and the hair growth from the previous time I did those diets was still pretty abundantly on my head, and looked good enough [as long as I wore hats](https://youtu.be/VKoSfmECpx0?si=iqPaLB1gmGQnd3xb). So the appreciation from his group (and him, actually), and the other group, probably is what helped that pubes regrowth (congrats), combined with the diet, but it’s not surprising that that hair gradually fell out, as almost all of my efforts were targeted towards connecting with people, socially, as, despite my serious efforts, through everything humanly possible that could've been advised or asked of me (everything, no matter what “more” or “less” idea popped into your head), I was becoming increasingly more alienated, connected to a yogic trance in nature at that point everyday that I didn't allow to get me hospitalized or disturb my work, and my isolation would remain to be the case until my best friend returned in 2023, who amazingly did not reject my insanity, whatsoever. Hence eyelashes.

My eyelashes started growing back for the first time in summer, 2023, when I'd started doing the steak/salmon-only diet again, and my best friend returned into my life, and fell out shortly after I was terminated, at which time I also had gone more lenient on my steak/salmon-only diet, due to the combination of more stress (from that termination) and lacking an income. Those three eyelashes that had grown back one by one gradually up to that point, that summer, starting that summer, grew back for the first time ever in the 5 full years since losing all of my hair. Then each fell out, but I attribute them to my best friend, who returned that summer, and probably also the correlating steak/salmon-only diet that I'd resumed before his return, earlier in 2023, after the weather had already gotten warm. Though, besides steak/salmon during that period when my eyelashes started to grow back for the first time, I allowed myself organic tea on that one, as well. Then, when I was terminated by this wonderful university of mine that had cost me my hair in the first place, my newly miracle'd eyelashes fell out suddenly.

However, adding this seems to undermine just how severe the injustice we're talking about is.

The bullies at the University of Rochester's hospital and research institutions don't understand that they botched every action they took in their judgements, treatments, policies, decision-making, and (as will be shown, though hopefully it's apparent already) rulings, and did everything humanly possible, sometimes by blunder rather than on purpose, to take away and waste my dignity, money, social life, physical body, and work.

#### Intimacy healing

[To do: After I finish my draft, when I'm comfortable telling anybody about this book, add: "This was shared with \<Lily's real name\>'s permission." or stick with "Lily."] [Already notified her about the book, still not ready to show her]

Depression, anxiety, PTSD, and [touch starvation](https://youtu.be/4zJXr4jeP5w?si=bQCCeK4_Cxv1MbL1) might be treatable through intimacy.

> [!WARNING]
> 
> In the hospital-provided housing that Lily got after the hospitalization, I visited for Thanksgiving. Her neighbor made food, including pork chops and mashed potatoes, that we ate in her neighbor's unit. I brought yams I'd made previously before the invitation.
> 
> Pork is not a metaphor for sex. Yams is not a metaphor for boobs. Thanksgiving is a metaphor for how grateful I was for the good food.
>
> She told me then that she'd had sex with the 50-something year old psychiatric ward janitor while hospitalized, in the psychiatric unit. They got into a relationship afterwards, and she'd broken up with him. 
>
> Through the captivity and drugging of her with benzos, the University of Rochester's Strong Hospital facilitated that.
>
> Benzos act like alcohol, and are incredibly personality-disinhibiting. They're even similar to GHB, also a GABA agonist, but which additionally acts on the GHB receptor. All three reduce consciousness, and predispose a horny person to making bad decisions, or good decisions based on a temporary need induced by confinement.
>
> However, perhaps there is a better alternative for those needs, in (1) treating them, rather than drugs, and (2) in self-treating them, rather than janitors. No drug-captivity-induced date-accident needed.
>
> But I'm sure she's thankful for your services (that's not sarcasm — hospital-provided outpatient housing is the most-medical thing they ever did).

I propose a new branch of medicine called intimacy healing, one with an ontology like as follows: communications as a subset of intimacy healing, intimacy healing as a subset of medicine, with overlaps but distinction from sex work. 

Independently, sex work should be legalized, regarded as a subset of fine art, formally and academically, but distinct from intimacy healing, and the branches of medicine and fine art can overlap.

Radical idea, but that's the direction. Humans need each other. Relationships are the most fundamental part of life, more of a basic necessity than food, water, shelter, or drugs.

Perhaps my alternative would've served better, and given her a spiritual, healthy way to resolve a human struggle that all of us share.

#### The artificial and synthetic

I'm all for [#SexycareForAll](#comedic-aside-sexier-moments-during-chenliang-tenure), but that's not quite what I have to say.
- And note, via humans.

The use of drugs, porn, movies, TV shows, and technologies shouldn't be judged or shamed. 

Many people are happy relying on those things, others appreciate the art.

Big pharma companies find value in their mass proliferation re: drugs.

And tech companies find value in their mass proliferation re: porn, fleshlights, dildos.

I'm anti-prohibition. My message is only this: the best experiences of a person's life shouldn't be synthetic. Those experiences should be brought into the real world, for people who want or need them, where the experiences people need and want are available foremost in the real world, via people, sincerely, intimately, and via touch, no matter one's "social class." [Imagine all the people, living life in peace.](https://youtu.be/YkgkThdzX-8?si=YNzRr6gnKtG4jywG)

And that must be understood as distinct from capitalistic drug-like fixes that people pay for.

Intimacy healing is a step towards that, starting with medical institutions.

#### AI
  
AI is a field with a lot of ethics questions, and the [militaristic](https://www.politico.eu/article/robots-coming-ukraine-testing-ground-ai-artificial-intelligence-powered-combat-war-russia/), [survelliance](https://bigdatachina.csis.org/the-ai-surveillance-symbiosis-in-china/#:~:text=With%20regard%20to%20China%2C%20it,data%20acquired%20through%20government%20contracts.) uses out there, in combination with this paper factory progress and pressure to turn out papers, is a boding sign that those questions are being answered extraordinarily incorrectly by the people giving the grades.

### Niaz Abdolrahim (okay, some more not-tragedy)

In my fourth year, I was assigned to also work in the Mechanical Engineering group that Niaz (who was a great PI) led. Then in my 6th year, it was still while working half-part there, with Niaz, Chenliang, and team, that Chenliang (who symbolically led the deep learning side of the work, with me leading the deep learning side of the work) called me into his office in the CS building where his lab meetings, including me (both my office and attendance to those meetings, as well), were held, towards which most of my 70-hour-per-week labor was going, to inform me that he didn't think I had enough papers (this was while he knew we were in the middle of a paper-review, a paper on which I had second-author, on which Chenliang, and according to Chenliang, Niaz, had previously offered me first-author — and I rejected — twice — out of fairness to the other PhD student — for a paper with highly positive reviews), and due to that low number of publications, he would be deserting.

The paper got accepted, after my termination notice and on the day before my last day as an employed student, in fact, synchronistically, a minute after I referenced it in the email I sent shown in the next ["Disproof" chapter](3-Disproof.md#email-10302023).

Chenliang put me on the Mechanical Engineering lab as the source of my funding, on a project which I led, which was funded by two pretty-major grants that I helped write, which included my ideas, which somehow, by Chenliang's and very-much-not-Niaz's decision, wouldn't fund me any longer.

Niaz, not an "opposing view," and someone I really like, was my other Principle Investigator next to Chenliang. Oh but to be clear, I was still in Chenliang's lab and reporting to that lab as well every week. I was doing extreme amounts of work for both, the latter of which I haven't really started describing yet. 

For Niaz's group, I did a lot of programming, data generation and pipeline-optimizing; much of the systems; idea invention and schematic designing; grant-idea-providing-and-writing-and-diagram-designing; and all of the model building and experiment running and plotting.

In Chenliang's group, I was still trying to do my own research, which was pretty heavily bottlenecked. That's part of why I was practicing every discipline imaginable — from Wim Hof method freezing cold baths to Transcendental Meditation to yoga to strict steak/salmon-only diet to every ascetecism I could not-hope for — to achieve the [full scope](https://github.com/AGI-init/UnifiedML-legacy) of what I wanted to do for [both](https://github.com/AGI-init/XRDs).

When Chenliang told me he couldn't be my advisor, I asked Niaz if she could be. She said the process of transferring to the mechanical engineering department formally wasn't that simple, that maybe she could contact the Dean, and that she sympathized sincerely. She also advised that I reach out to the CARE Network, something I at first took some mild offense to, because I messaged her on Slack about the key specifics of the medical institution hair and benzo trauma, and she clarified, no, she meant reaching out to them for a lawyer. I appreciated that. I'm grateful Chenliang forced me on that work because of Niaz. But I did a lot for them in the Mechanical Engineering department, concurrent with my studies in AI separately in his lab, and I had no choice because that project's grants, were funding me, and I helped write two of their big ones (endowing the pretty-small group with upwards of a million dollars), with their names as authors and me uncredited. I did a lot of engineering and data work for them that was independent to my research, that ordinarily would get paid a 6-figure salary for, while I have never been paid more than $15/hr in my life, and the termination left me with tons of student debt.

So you see, because my family was poor, my student debt (for the University of Rochester) was subsidized for as long as I was a student. So when I was terminated, that interest started accumulating, and I had/have to pay them/the lenders the large sum of money (in the above-the-Biden-loan-cancellation ranges, even the Pell grant one I would've gotten). So literally speaking, financially, I was “indebted for their services” for terminating me, which I had to swallow. This is the same University of Rochester I've been describing for multiple chapters now.

Makes me want to go #NotEnoughPapers, for the many thousands of dollars reverse-severance they gave me as gratitude.

However, that lab is the least of the work I did ([here](5-Early-work-in-program.md)/[here](6-Indebted.md)/[here](https://github.com/AGI-init/UnifiedML-legacy)/[here](https://github.com/AGI-init/XRDs)/[here](https://github.com/slerman12/Builder)/[here](https://github.com/AGI-init/Tributaries)/[here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ZQFeiOKSU2teVGg5EHlgREAi8pJY_Mr1CJ3H2pfFBfI/edit?usp=sharing)), at sometimes slave wage by force, with PhD requirements that were usually uniquely put on me, from the same institution that mutilated the hair and youth from my body and face, and neurochemically gassed my brain, then terminated me and scapegoated me for their 6 years of atrocities, negligences, and greed.

They Holocausted me.

They Holocausted me. By whatever legal definition exists, they Holocausted me. Every lawyer agrees, that by whatever legal definition exists, they Holocausted me.

Now rewind in time a bit. Not to the days of the Canaanites, but to the days before Chris Kanan.

Two of my advisors and two of my committee members deserted, for funsies, e.g. sabbaticals (I barely had time for Sabbath), promotions, retirement, funding reallocation, etc., and I was left with a brand new interim committee, consisting of Chenliang Xu, who had just announced his desertion, Charles Venuto, who worked in the Med Center and had no expertise in AI, Chris Kanan, last-minute added interim committee member, and Tom Howard, last-minute added interim committee member.

I never effectively met half of my committee, we had one 20-minute Zoom call in which I presented, and then an after-room discussion.

In defense of the committee members who agreed on the decision, most of them didn't know me and hadn't met each other or me previously, and one of them, Chris Kanan, in a kind of *deus ex machina* (or so I thought, since that should have conclusively settled it), [mis-remembered](https://github.com/slerman12/BrokenWisdoms/blob/Ancillary/Deus-Ex-Memory.md) the short Zoom meeting that the four of us had (I highly recommend clicking on that link), on which these decisions from their end were based, as being 1.5 hours and twice. That is quite a lapse in memory (and Chris Kanan is the youngest). The meeting was 30 minutes, and once, as the other committee members may recall and confirm. The calendar invitation that that committee member, Chris Kanan, accepted, wrote: "Friday May 5, 2023 ⋅ 1pm – 1:45pm (Eastern Time - New York)" (extra lag time added). I have on email to one committee member Tom Howard that we planned half an hour: "Would you be available any of the following dates for a half-hour remote 6-month review?" It can be confirmed that it was 30 minutes in which I had to summarize 6 years of work over Zoom: 20ish minutes spent on my presentation, then 5ish minutes for their independent-room discussion and 5 minutes for their concluding remarks. 

I should add details about the work that Chris Kanan asked me to do, or suggested rather, that I followed through on. Maybe in this [chapter](3-Disproof.md) and [this one](6-Indebted.md), but see terminator-bubble-diagram immediately above and I'll summarize below.

Long-term memory is what I was working on longest. From the Spring semester of my Freshman year, 
- when I built a long-term episodic memory reinforcement learning controller on top of image features from Felzenshwalb segmentation in Chenliang Xu's machine vision class,
- to that semester where I actually did meet Tom Howard for 5 minutes and told him about using the idea for robotics when we went to his robotics lab because he took an interest (and that short exchange is the only time I talked to him prior to this),
- to when I impressed a researcher at DeepMind at NeurIPS (then called "NIPS") 2018 about MHDPA — taht I was using for a related concept, [as seen in my area exam slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1LK0urIs8yu_e7HyZ-VQoDJUiGpPeTPEUgfhjK5Kw_7w/edit?usp=sharing) — in Montreal (and still have the different conversation with Jürgen Schmidhuber that I got to have at that conference evidenced in our email record, whose hand I'm glad I got to shake at the end of his presentation), and by the way I remember coding my MHDPA paper in that stay's hotel,
- to plenty of email-record (e.g. with Prof. Len Schubert),
- as well as my area exam,
- as well as my thesis proposal,
- as well as what I was doing at the Med Center that Charles Venuto has email record and memory of,
- up to even this meeting with the new committee, where I showed [all of what I had done on that (lifelong, adaptive, rewritable, growing, accelerated Replay Memory for use in RL or supervised learning or generative modeling) and more](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ZQFeiOKSU2teVGg5EHlgREAi8pJY_Mr1CJ3H2pfFBfI/edit?usp=sharing).

Coincidentally, they all had evidence that this is something I was trying to do through my full PhD, and *for some reason* — I'll let you guess why — maybe didn't get to. Everybody wanted me to pursue their different independent area research. Except Chris Kanan. Who suggested, wisely, after that 20-minute Zoom meeting, by email one month after I delivered a big new research proposal as they insanely requested, that I develop a brand new reinforcement learning systems algorithm for my giant built-from-scratch deep learning library/framework [UnifiedML](https://github.com/slerman12/Builder), and I did within two months ([here is one of the commits](https://github.com/slerman12/Builder/commit/e8b896c75bdeb388995af912a25108dfa16a92f9) when I finished implementing [it, sampling without replacement within a priority, accelerated, parallelized, hard-disk-memory-mappable Replay Memory using truly-shared RAM memory, dynamically growable and rewritable and unified with supervised and generative modeling](https://github.com/AGI-init/UnifiedML/blob/ef14f7ff14b0b494d14bc8ee4bfe8925ad2a1fb3/ML/World/Replay.py#L566-L607), innovating on the state of the art reinforcement learning algorithm/system DrQV2, which very much does not do the vast majority of those things), the day before the meeting with Chenliang, when I told him about my algorithm/system in [my UnifiedML framework](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ZQFeiOKSU2teVGg5EHlgREAi8pJY_Mr1CJ3H2pfFBfI/edit?usp=sharing) — and it actually is brilliant — and he liked it dismissively, then proceeded to tell me he couldn't be my advisor because I didn't have enough papers. It was a good meeting, but he didn't know what he was doing.

It is the first rewritable DataLoader that serves as a Replay for supervised, generative, and reinforcement learning as well as the novel algorithm for sampling without replacement, something that is standardly done in the former two but had never been done for priority experience replays in the latter, especially not in combination with lifelong storage capacity via [dynamic device allocation](https://github.com/slerman12/Builder/blob/64c92d7bf5c09642e161548c36625739884b01f7/UnifiedML/src/ML/World/Memory.py#L103-L107), [hard disk memory mapping](https://github.com/slerman12/Builder/blob/64c92d7bf5c09642e161548c36625739884b01f7/UnifiedML/src/ML/World/Memory.py#L524-L543), and [truly-shared in-RAM adaptive memory](https://github.com/slerman12/Builder/blob/64c92d7bf5c09642e161548c36625739884b01f7/UnifiedML/src/ML/World/Memory.py#L59-L150), in other words though extremely reductive: an accelerated parallelized DataLoader whose contents can be changed by the agent, and which include generalized sampling methods even when the dataset size is growing such as in a priority experience replay for DataLoader, and all of this added with a truly state of the art reinforcement learning algorithm/system DrQV2 as well as others with support for continuous and discrete domains, online or offline learning, and on-policy or off-policy, all of which — yes, all of which — I generalized into a unified API and framework to fully support supervised, generative, and reinforcement learning, the most general DataLoader/Experience Replay/Memory ever built, capable also of storing and updating parameters, not just data, meaning all of this with support for deep neural Memory, not just dataset-centric. Nothing like it exists — I’m afraid PyTorch or somebody will try to copy it upon reading this. The value of it was so immense and this brand new interim committee — all except Chris Kanan — had not the faintest scent of that — well, that's not true, Chenliang thought I could start a business and just cared about papers, but note, I needed his GPUs to finish. By the way, pretty much fully implemented, [and elegantly so](https://github.com/slerman12/Builder/blob/main/UnifiedML/src/ML/World/Memory.py) (but with no GPUs to finalize the small amount of work left on the library/framework as a whole, nor funding or undestroyed-human-spirit left to write the immense amount of documentation still needed, and personally, I think this book takes priority, not to mention, I've released all the code open-source under the MIT license, so traditional funding routes aren't an option anyway, plus I have other interconnected plans for my research, if given the reigns/money-rains to make it happen). Since I started building it for my PhD (from about 2021, in Chenliang's lab, onwards), some similar works have come out, like PyTorch’s entire reinforcement learning library, but none compare (the system was being built within a GATO/JEPA-type framework before either of those were published/announced). And has an [interface that plug-and-play substitutes the normal PyTorch DataLoader](https://github.com/slerman12/Builder/blob/main/UnifiedML/src/ML/World/Replay.py). It’s also accelerated and faster in every substantive way for supervised, too, at least Pytorch's default DataLoader, but possibly the more intricate accelerators, and was the first infrastructure in Chenliang Xu’s Computer Vision lab [capable of training ImageNet efficiently from scratch](https://github.com/slerman12/Builder/blob/main/tributaries-ml/src/tributaries/Examples/Sweeps/ImageNet.py), something not one other student in his Computer Vision lab — even with the most published papers — had (and probably "has" as of time of writing) ever done. To be clear, I was the first student in his PhD lab’s history — officially ranked one of the [top in the world in Computer Vision](https://csrankings.org/#/fromyear/2020/toyear/2024/index?vision&us) — to use any infrastructure (his or otherwise) for training ImageNet from scratch (meaning, not via fine-tuning an ImageNet-pre-trained model, nor just using a subset of the ImageNet dataset), the gold standard of his field, all within a GATO/JEPA type generalized (and more general than either of them) framework (whose construction also preceded both of those, by the way). That being said, his students, perhaps more so than Chenliang, appreciated what I was doing, though Chenliang knew it could've been valuable, and was good enough for a PhD. Both him and Niaz said I was ready to defend. Chenliag wanted me to write my thesis before he cut his funding, yet again on an impossible deadline. But a thesis is more important than a conference paper, and I couldn't have.

### Tom Howard

The independent-room discussion reasonably marked the end of my portion of the meeting, or so I thought. However, after the independent-room discussion, we kept talking, I left, and Chenliang later told me that the committee members thought I dropped the line early. That was a misunderstanding. I really thought the meeting was over since they conveyed everything I had to do next, or at least that they were going to in that discussion. At the very, very end of the discussion, one of the committee members, Tom Howard, said, “I just want to add, I think it’s important.” I actually in my sleep deprivation thought he meant my work (I suspect he probably meant the chapter-list), so I did a sincere and prolonged “bless you” sign with my hands in the silence and left. I know that this is the least believable part. Chenliang knew via Slack I hadn’t slept that whole night, due to insomnia and maybe-nervousness, and I mentioned that "I didn't sleep all night" during the meeting to which I think Tom Howard off-handedly, maybe-non-noticedly said "I know," before resuming his point. 

Chenliang had to take his dog to the vet, for that matter. Either his wife did or him, but the meeting had to be no more than half an hour by what he told me. How we scheduled, over Slack. 
- If I left early, it’s further justified by what Chenliang wrote to me on Slack, about needing to take his dog to the vet immediately after the meeting, assumed 30 minutes, his wife possibly being able to do it, or otherwise having to reschedule the vet to later in the day, all of which probably can be verified with either his vet or his wife or just his calender.

He (Tom Howard) concluded the meeting saying “I just want to add, I think it’s important” in reference to the chapter-list, and I did a "bless you" sign with my hands, as I'd on previous occasion felt the need to do after a robotics-related pitch to Chenliang's group coincidentally, in-person in Chenliang's lab, and robotics is Tom Howard's field. That was a coincidence though. It was just a vivid moment in Chenliang's lab, with all of his students there as witness, when he agreed to buy me one of the $300 Bittle robots that I could use with the robotics software that I [built](https://github.com/AGI-init/tributaries/blob/main/Examples/Sweeps/Bittle.py), that I did a "bless you" sign for in gratitude. I meant it in a similar way to Tom Howard, but I interpreted “I just want to add, I think it’s important” as being in reference to my research, not the chapter-list.

The chapter-list was the only requirement they wanted to make in that meeting. We had the entire after-independent-room discussion and they didn't specify anything other than the chapter-list. I'm sure they weren't going to. Perhaps one of them can even confirm that nothing more than the chapter-list was discussed as extra requirement in their independent-room meeting. That was clear from context.

But afterwards, I got an email — I think from Chenliang and perhaps from the graduate coordinator — specifying two altogether different requirements, with only an auxiliary mention of the chapter-list. Here they were, as apparently decided by the committee (post-hoc) after their chapter-list decision in the actual six-month review:

> ### $\Huge &#8220;$
> As remediation, the committee asks the student to
>
> 1.   before June 5, 2023, provide a 1-page write up that addresses the problem statement, hypothesis, and approaches of the thesis and give an outline of thesis chapters,
> 2.    before August 30, 2023, re-do and pass a six-month review.
> ### $\Huge &#8221;$

It's ironic that I'm being asked for remediation.

I don't know who decided these extra requirements, if it was the CS chair Michael Scott, or Tom Howard, or Chris Kanan, or even Chenliang.

I delivered a 6-page write up, as well as a chapter-list, as well as a 1-page write up summary in the 6-page write up, meeting all of the requirements of (1) for this brand new interim committee that effectively never met me. 

Subsequently, Chris Kanan suggested that I innovate a new reinforcement learning systems-based algorithm (also suggesting it post-hoc), which I did, as I described [above](#chris-kanan).

These are enormous requirements that I met on their behalf.

Tom Howard didn't make any tangible, explicit, or otherwise suggestions, nor did my advisor or Charles. (The committee consisted of 4 people, my advisor Chenliang, Chris Kanan, Tom Howard, and Charles).

The actual six-month review was **May 5th, 2023**. Then Chenliang notified me of his desertion on **July 24th, 2023**, a day after I finished implementing the [novel reinforcement learning systems-based algorithm](https://github.com/AGI-init/UnifiedML/blob/ef14f7ff14b0b494d14bc8ee4bfe8925ad2a1fb3/ML/World/Replay.py#L566-L607) (and [here](https://github.com/slerman12/Builder/commit/e8b896c75bdeb388995af912a25108dfa16a92f9) is the specific commit), and Chenliang confirmed by email the desertion for the rest of the committee and Michael Scott on **August 10th, 2024**, the same day as my [early in-advance-of notice](https://github.com/slerman12/BrokenWisdoms/blob/Ancillary/Not-Enough-Carbs.md) to the committee and Michael Scott that I wouldn't attend the requirement (2), prior to the **August 30, 2023** date of requirement (2).

I have to elaborate more on Charles since he was on my six-month review committee.

Charles was still on my committee from the Med Center years, but was about to be replaced after this latest six-month review by my PI of the last several years [Niaz](#niaz-abdolrahim) (the work for whom was funding me), as she agreed.

Charles was my Med Center advisor. Charles and Henry both oversaw me in those first 3 years, before Henry's promotion meant I had to switch into Chenliang's lab and start an altogether new Computer Vision-branch focus of research, with an ultimatum to submit a top-venue paper that summer *in* Computer Vision, literally a brand new field to me. And I did. Amazingly. Though that seems to be unappreciated (the benchmarks and conventions for actual acceptance, though not necessarily principle of concept, are more elaborate than just plopping MHDPA on top of a CNN, had I done that). However, the [explainability-centric paper that I came up with, derived, wrote, and programmed](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.08601) would not have been my preferred research area, since I was working on MHDPA and long-term episodic memory methods for Charles in the Med Center (and Henry) prior to that, and wrote [my novel MHDPA method paper](https://www.overleaf.com/read/qgmmzgsrctmg#6cd1b9) before MHDPA had any popularity or reknown outside of small groups at DeepMind. MHDPA, for the uninitiated, became the backbone, 5 years later, of foundation models like ChatGPT. Henry doubted my obsession with the method back in 2018. No one at the university heard of it. And when switching to Chenliang's lab, he wasn't too thrilled with the idea of applying it to Semantic Image Segmentation, in what would've been perhaps (with some rarely-credited DeepMind experiments at the time having already done it on CNNs as the exception) the first Vision Transformer (since it would've had to convincingly beat baseline scores on Computer Vision benchmarks, which those DeepMind experiments hadn't applied the method on, and rarely are given the credit, despite unified principle of concept). So instead, under an employment-contingent ultimatum, I co-wrote my ICCV [Taylor-CAM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.08601) paper under Chenliang with Henry and Charles. Charles and I managed to sneak biomedical modeling into the appendix (see Appendix J, rather invisible).

I credited Charles as co-author on that paper, however they at the Med Center did not credit me for the prototype of the disease prognostication [model]((https://github.com/slerman12/DiseaseModeling)) (since developed since that original version that won in the PPMI contest, mentioned early [above](#charles-venuto)) and [website]((https://github.com/slerman12/DiseaseModelingWebApp)) I came up with, had to argue for, built, and presented in DC in front of reknowned Parkinson's disease researchers, a poster and live demo presentation that also wasn't credited (and not to mention was still amid the very peak of my benzo withdrawal, that I had to take a benzo for to present).

I haven't spoken to Charles since we added that biomedical component to my [Taylor-CAM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.08601) paper and he didn't say a word during the six-month review. I mean not a word, except — maybe — hi, and his video was off. That's 1/4 of the deciding committee, whose decision hinged on that meeting (on whose decision around that meeting determined my termination), who didn't have his video on or say a word during the deciding meeting. The other two were brand new interim replacements for other committee members who were absent. So that just leaves my advisor Chenliang, who didn't want to terminate me, who just wanted to reallocate my funding from the Mechanical Engineering group due to not enough papers in his Computer Vision group, and who believed my research was satisfactory enough to defend that month (of my termination), if I just "followed [his] formatting instructions" for the thesis that I hadn't started writing, that he thought I could write quickly.

So in other words: Chris Kanan (who [didn't remember the meeting](https://github.com/slerman12/BrokenWisdoms/blob/Ancillary/Deus-Ex-Memory.md)) and Tom Howard fully determined my termination, besides Michael L. Scott.

> The [eczema this is presently giving me](https://github.com/slerman12/BrokenWisdoms/blob/Ancillary/Eczema.md) as I type is severe. My arms are scathing red. I'm itchy and can't sleep, rolling around under my blankets in a burning panic, nails grinding to skin on arms, trying to shed the stress from this inflicted evil of judgement. The reader's possible mixed perceptions in my head, all the ways this could be re-done to be made more convincing and believed haunting the scorching thought rivers. Like ants on my arms literally, burning rivers as blood, my arteries need to be dug of their hidden psychological poison, my brain says; my brain pierces and threatens as it sends those coursing swarms stingingly down the lengths of my typing limbs, even now, as I try to put that burning disturbing pleasure and agony into words, if not the claws of my nails where skin residue bulks and swells. Please reader in the hidden ether, stop doing this to me. Send love, not this terror of threat and divided consciousness that broils as war between my body and the depths of my mind and senses.

> The torment doesn't stop until I finish this. I'm slave driven by my skin, as I was by my advisors, committees, and professors. I fear that you are all so stupid, that none of you will see the truth of this, that you will act as allies to the contagion that plagues my stress rather than as people who know the heart no matter the veil or law of land or powers that be.

Maybe one of the strongest Opposing Views, which the remainder of this book will be devoted to obliterating is the CS department Chair who comes in at this point for the first time in my PhD, Michael L. Scott (The Messenger as he'd might've called himself), or: The Judge.

His Opposing View is only strong because of its window of context. Unlike Chenliang and Charles, he didn’t know me. Unlike Chris Kanan, he wasn’t in my field. And unlike Tom Howard, he didn’t and couldn’t have even been relevant to a six-month review, since he had no background or expertise whatsoever in anything relevant to the future of his field (to be fair) or mine. The future of his field is my field, for that matter.

That makes him an extremely strong Opposing View.

Michael made a lot of false allegations prior to and after terminating me, in fact almost entirely false allegations, entirely false or hypocritical allegations. For most of the time, his belief was that he was terminating me for more serious reasons than the six-month review make-up. He believed my research was inadequate, “unviable,” and that I had to propose a new research “plan.” “Plan” — in one’s 6th year when advisor and PI already believed I could defend on the work that I had that month.

My advisor and PI weren’t right, because I needed peace to write my thesis. That’s where Michael’s exercise in unearned ruling authority (over me anyway) was the most extreme.

And suspicious.

I call this the Termination Slam.

His previous email read:

> ### $\Huge &#8220;$
> If I do not hear from you by 6 Oct., with a plan for successful completion, the department will terminate your stipend and discontinue your enrollment as of 31 Oct. 2023.
> ### $\Huge &#8221;$
> &ensp;&ensp;- **09/25/2023**

In other words, 'Send the department my "new research plan" (despite the advisor and PI believing I was ready to defend) by **10/06/2023**, now an added independent requirement to the previously delivered materials to the independent six-month review committee.'

Then I delivered another research plan, with precision and accuracy, by the specified date **10/06/2023**. 

This was the only reply I got, of **10/12/2023**:

> ### $\Huge &#8220;$
> Dear Sam:
>
> Thank you for your note of 6 Oct.  I have conferred with members of your committee.  They confirm that the plan you outline is neither consistent with what you originally proposed for the PhD nor a viable path to completion of the degree.  With regret, we will be terminating your student status and stipend as of the end of October.

I delivered what was requested and he put his boot down on my sincerity and effort. That boot despite what was threatened and said is why it was a Termination Slam, not just a termination. On personal and highly elaborate work that was sent to him (and CC'd Chenliang) about all of my research, and the plan to defend after I write my thesis.

Later, he specified the detail he didn’t like. No no, it wasn’t the research-related material, as he later self-contradicted, it was my request for “peace” towards the end.

However, this alone does not damn Michael. He was CC’d on or I sent him, *all* of the context. At first, he got the [medical context]() and only the research “context” from the brand new interim committee, later the research context, and gradually he realized that his only justification for the termination — despite what he previously specified — was a measly six-month review make-up, the one that was post-hoc both with respect to advisor desertion and requirement (which I warned [on **08/10/2023**](https://github.com/slerman12/BrokenWisdoms/blob/Ancillary/Not-Enough-Carbs.md) I wasn't going to attend, that Michael was CC'd for), and which is a formalism that isn’t under any ordinary PhD circumstance considered that important.

But at that point he stayed doubled down.

The boss battle was over, and I lost.

To be clear, what I mean is I disproved the whole constitution that they drew the make-up review requirement from, in math, and showed that they were violating their policy. That they are violating their policy. And that mathematically derived disproof [will appear in the Epilogue of the part titled "Ongoing"](7-Ongoing.md), not in the part titled "Disproof" ([coming up next](3-Disproof.md)).</sub>

#

Michael doesn’t know this, but in the systems class I took with him in undergrad, he gave me the lowest grade I’ve ever gotten in any class, ever, kindergarten through PhD, in a systems class, and I do not like systems (not the coercive kind anyway). He even bumped it up a very-very little. Now Michael ultimately relayed the ruling to terminate, on the "basis" of the committee, and not one, but, as he claimed, [two](7-Ongoing.md) six-month reviews ([and this make-up!](7-Ongoing.md)). Michael mentioned the possibility of applying for reinstatement, though what that means is unclear, especially as: Did he mean I needed to find yet another advisor, new source of funding, re-take a six-month review, do my thesis, and do all of this still recovering from traumas in my 6th year, for less than New York State's legal living wage, or no pay, within the next one to few months? 

See "Slavery or impossible" [here](3-Disproof.md) (in the next chapters) for elaboration on what was demanded on me *together with* the six-month review make-up.

For all of the aforementioned reasons, and final, I was terminated without degree. 6 years of the hardest work the university has ever seen thrown away and spit on, with no accountability, from the same single monopoly and institution that induced multiple medical malpractices on me, mutilated me into looking like Gollum literally, and put me through a literal physiological coerced burning hellfire for more than a year that can't be described. Meanwhile, those years in the program involved two advisors leaving due to no fault of my own, having to work in the Medical Center and Mechanical Engineering department for funding, and a quarter to a half a year as I worked for Chenliang for free.

These are just words. He didn't acknowledge anything I said, separately or together. He occasionally wrote that he disagreed with the characterization, and made no argument as to why.

### Summary of why interim

The committee that terminated me was a brand new *interim* committee, for just one meeting, for which they post-hoc wanted a make-up before the next one that they wouldn’t even attend. 

Since I had to switch advisors, and my PI Niaz agreed to be on my defense committee instead of Charles (by my advisor’s suggestion just prior to the six-month review), and another committee member was returning, and assuming my old advisor would still remain on the committee, that means the entire brand new committee (3/4 members) — including all of the ones who made the termination decision and ruled that I needed a new research “plan” in my 6th year — were leaving. After that one 30-minute video call, they assumed all governing power over my studies, labor, and employment, simply because other faculty members left without warning (abandoned/deserted their "posts") last-minute. More egregiously, in case that doesn’t stress it, 2/4 of them (3/5 if you count Michael) aren’t in my field and have no background or expertise in my field. The only 1/4 who did, next to my advisor, was Chris Kanan, the one who provided the [Deus Ex Memory](https://github.com/slerman12/BrokenWisdoms/blob/Ancillary/Deus-Ex-Memory.md) in which he forgot the meeting, and on whose behalf I invented a new RL systems algorithm in less than 2 months during this 3 month period. 

That’s the whole story, and where in there is even the slightest administrative sense or rational mandate to make life-altering decisions?
