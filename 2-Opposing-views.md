# Opposing views

The opposing view in defense of my university-hospital doctor is, she might have had something else going on, or was too busy. Later, she took pictures of the hair loss with her nurse and diagnosed it honestly as alopecia universalis due to the sudden cessation of Dupilumab. The opposing view in defense of my university-provided health insurance company Aetna is, they maybe didn’t notice that I had already been on the drug for a long time (I don’t remember the exact duration but between 6 months and 1 year) and wanted to save money. In defense of the university intermediaries who were in charge of providing and delivering the drug on a recurring schedule, they couldn’t contact the doctor and the doctor might have been on vacation or any other reason she might not have been reachable at the time; and, as mentioned, she was honest in directly diagnosing the rapid loss of my hair to the sudden cessation of Dupilumab. 

I should add one for the doctors who coerced the benzodiazepine prescriptions and brain damaged me.

In defense of Chenliang: he eventually accepted me into his lab after Henry left, pressured me into writing a paper sooner, and stayed generally nice throughout the time, while not expressing judgement towards my social anxiety. He sometimes had a good understanding of AI. His spirit, in my confusion-views, promised me many things. He contradictorily seemed to respect my slower publication pace while I built UnifiedML, and I believed he "knew" that I was intelligent enough to warrant his investment. Also, 2 publications in 3 years is (I think) less than his average student.

Michael, bumped my grade up in undergrad. Wasn't judgemental, sent many "talk?" emails, sort of kind of; one "talk?" email, one previous invitation to meet, but also no reply to my acceptance to meet; and mentioned the possibility of reinstatement at the end. He patiently waited and tolerated my incessant emails as I tried to defend myself, but ultimately took the word of the committee members. In defense of them, most of them didn't know me and hadn't met each other or me previously, and one of them mis-remembered the short 30-minute Zoom meeting that the four of us had as being 1.5 hours and twice. It was 30 minutes, and once, as the other committee members can recall. It was scheduled for 30 minutes: 20 minutes reserved for my presentation and the last 10 minutes for their independent-room discussion and final remarks. In defense of them, I did drop the line early after their final remarks, according to Chenliang, but I did a "bless you" sign with my hands that they didn't see and I thought the meeting was over since they conveyed everything I had to do next, which I did. (This is sincere, but it's the least believable part. Note also: my previous committee members had not been available for reasons that had nothing to do with me). Independent to that meeting, and prior to any confrontations or required deadlines, Chenliang stated that he would no longer support me in the Fall due to not enough papers.
