# Opposing views

The opposing view in defense of my university-hospital doctor is, she might have had something else going on. Or, equivalently, I can only guess she was too busy. But when she took pictures of the hair loss with her nurse there present and diagnosed it honestly as alopecia universalis due to the sudden cessation of Dupilumab, she was kind and genuinely well-intentioned. The opposing view in defense of Aetna, the university-provided health insurance company, is: they, uh, maybe didn’t notice that I had already been on the drug for a long time (I don’t remember the exact duration but between 6 months and 1 year) and, wanted to save money. The insurance decided to cut me off spontaneously and without warning, from a potent biologic agent that I had to inject periodically into my stomach, that laser-targeted a specific antibody to fight eczema. In defense of the university intermediaries who were in charge of providing and delivering the drug on the prescribed recurring schedule, they couldn’t contact the doctor and the doctor might have had other things going on, because she was nowhere to be seen or reached, nor the health insurance in complying with the intermediating deliverer owned by the university. As mentioned, the doctor, Lisa Beck, directly diagnosed the rapid loss of my hair to the sudden cessation of Dupilumab. All of my hair, including eyebrows and eyelashes, was/is gone.

I should add one for the doctors who coerced the benzodiazepine prescriptions and brain damaged me. I was going to leave it out because it was excruciatingly traumatic and is hard to revisit. In the hospital they forced me to take many orders higher a dosage than I had ever taken, at many orders higher the frequency, and promised to wean me off before I left the hospital. Last-minute, they changed their minds and said the outpatient doctor would wean me off. He didn't, and I was on them for 6 months at an extreme dosage. When I told him of the severely worsening cognitive impairments, he wanted to increase the dosage. Prior to this, I used to take the medication on an as-needed basis, at most once every 2 weeks, prescribed to help eczema-related stress and social anxiety, about a quarter of a milligram, and that much gave me hangovers. They coerced me in the hospital to take many orders more than that 3x per day, every day. At first, it was like being drunk every day and pleasant. After a month, the experience was like burning in Hell. Excruciating agony, on top of inability to think or remember. All the while I begged my doctors to wean me off and argued *to them* the dangers of benzodiazepines, since they first forced me onto them at that dosage at the hospital, coercively, *against* my will. I have no defense for their actions. Even "they were just doing their jobs" doesn't cut it. I was in severe withdrawal and agony halfway in and the enormous pain didn't go away for another year or more. Every neuron in my brain was behaving as if I was being mauled by a bear, without pause, day and night, every minute.

There were further terrors at the University of Rochester Medical Center that I don't want to get into (one of the easier ones to point out, that happened later, was my big toe getting running over by the wheelchair I was in as the nurse pushed it, me screaming in pain, and with the nurse rolling me off and other nurses all ignoring). Concurrent with this, while I was still in withdrawal from the benzodiazepines and after my third year in the PhD program, I was forced to switch from being Henry Kautz's student because Henry got a prestigious position offer to direct at the NSF that he accepted. In defense of Henry, he'd already done a lot for me, and had no formal background or experience with deep learning to facilitate my research studies compared to, who he recommended, Chenliang Xu, whose lab I had to then fight to get into, with an ultimatum pressed on me to write a top-venue paper, from scratch, by the end of that summer for him or be rejected advisor-less from the PhD program.

In defense of Chenliang: he eventually accepted me into his lab (when I succesfully delivered that paper, even early, while still in the nightmare depths of the benzo withdrawal), and stayed generally nice throughout the time, while not expressing judgement towards my social anxiety. He sometimes had a good understanding of AI, better than others at the university. His spirit, sometimes, felt extraordinarily supportive. He contradictorily wanted efficiency with somewhat respecting my slower publication pace while I built UnifiedML, and I believed he fully knew that I was intelligent enough to warrant investing faith in. While 2 publications in 3 years is (I think) less than his average student, that was, however, his only reason for terminating me when I was in my sixth year, three years later.

In defense of the committee members who agreed on the decision, most of them didn't know me and hadn't met each other or me previously, and one of them, in a kind of *deus ex machina* (or so I thought, since that should have conclusively settled it), [mis-remembered](https://github.com/slerman12/Detective-Sam/blob/main/4-Faith.md) the short 30-minute Zoom only meeting that the four of us had, on which these decisions from their end were based, as being 1.5 hours and twice. That is quite a lapse in memory. The meeting was 30 minutes, and once, as the other committee members may recall and confirm. And, the calendar invitation that that committee member, Chris Kanan, accepted, wrote: "Friday May 5, 2023 ⋅ 1pm – 1:45pm (Eastern Time - New York)" (extra lag time added). Also, I have on email to one committee member Tom Howard that we planned half an hour: "Would you be available any of the following dates for a half-hour remote 6-month review?" So, as can be easily confirmed or sufficiently evidenced, it was indeed 30 minutes with our brand new committee in which I had to summarize 6 years of work over Zoom: 20ish minutes spent on my presentation and the remaining on their independent-room discussion and concluding remarks. The independent-room discussion reasonably marked the end of my portion of the meeting, or so I thought. However, after the independent-room discussion, we kept talking, I left, and Chenliang later told me that the committee members thought I dropped the line early. That was a misunderstanding. I really thought the meeting was over since they conveyed everything I had to do next, or at least that they were going to in that discussion. At the very, very end of the discussion, one of the committee members, Tom Howard, said, “I just want to add, I think it’s important.” I actually in my sleep deprivation thought he meant my work (I know he probably meant the chapter-list), so I did a sincere and prolonged “bless you” sign with my hands in the silence and left. I know that this is the least believable part. Chenliang knew I hadn’t slept that whole night, due to insomnia and maybe-nervousness, and I mentioned that I "didn't sleep all night" during the meeting to which I think Tom Howard off-handedly, maybe-non-noticedly said "I know," before resuming his point. Since Charles Venuto was the only person on the committee who knew me since I began the program, when I worked for him in the Medical Center in my undergrad and in the [first 3 years](https://github.com/slerman12/Detective-Sam/blob/main/5-Early-work-in-program.md) of my PhD, including at one point as my funding source for my PhD even as I worked for free for Chenliang, I reassured him via email, without prompt, not to worry, out of that same sincere/maybe-naive kindness that I suspect is hard to believe. The other previous committee members, from those [first 5 years of my PhD](https://github.com/slerman12/Detective-Sam/blob/main/6-Indebted.md), had not been available for reasons that had nothing to do with me (besides my first advisor leaving, there was also retirement, sabbatical, and then second advisor leaving — 4 huge unexpected departures that the grad school should've had to be accountable for). After the meeting, I was formally sent two requirements, one with a June 5th deadline and another with a August 30th deadline. In addition to that, committee member Chris Kanan made recommendations on email that I innovate some new systems-level RL algorithm for UnifiedML. It was a good vague suggestion. I actually did this, successfully, and reported it to Chenliang later. I also met the first deadline, with everything as requested and additional information and longer page-count. Independent to that meeting, and prior to any confrontations or that second deadline, Chenliang stated that he would no longer support me in the Fall due to not enough papers, on July 24th. I achieved 2 papers in the 3 years under Chenliang and was in the middle of a paper review. On August 30th, I informed the grad school of everything and missed the make-up review, matching another time, as Michael will illucidate, that I missed a review due to highly extenuating and excused circumstances. After multiple contradictory reasons, they finally decided this (the missed August 30th make-up review) was the reason for terminating me in my sixth year as a PhD student (and tenth at the University of Rochester). In summary, a brand new committee, who had never met me, decided to confer with my advisor's decision, for altogether different "reasons".

Now, in defense of Dr. Michael L. Scott, the messenger:

Michael doesn't know this, but he bumped my grade up in undergrad once. Now he ultimately relayed the ruling to terminate, on the basis of the committee, and not one, but, as he claimed, [two](https://github.com/slerman12/Detective-Sam/blob/main/7-Ongoing.md) six-month reviews. Michael mentioned the possibility of applying for reinstatement, though what that means is unclear, especially as: Did he mean I needed to find yet another advisor, new source of funding, re-take a six-month review, do my thesis, and do all of this amid health issues in my sixth year, for less than New York State's legal living wage, within the next one to few months? 

Something I didn't mention or elaborate on here yet: Chenliang lied, as soon as I sent [my first email](https://github.com/slerman12/Detective-Sam/blob/main/4-Faith.md) to the committee. Here's a story that Chenliang knows is true: After he notified me of his leaving and my income being cut, I reached out my hand to shake his hand, he didn't shake it, and then I said, "I consider you someone I personally hold dear", and patted my heart with my hand as I left his office and another student entered. I meant it. That's why I refrained from telling the other committee members and Michael that Chenliang lied in his reply email until after they had formally notified me of my termination. This was the fabrication, on email: "Dr. Niaz Abdolrahim delivered my message to you [... that] I can continue to provide funding support (Sep, Oct, Nov)." No, she did not. She didn't say anything about continued funding support. She can confirm, though she didn't risk their professional relationship by replying either when I CC'd her. Even if she had offered any words of financial security for between then and November, November time limit before losing my funding and having to find my third PhD advisor, in my sixth year, on short-notice, in the context of the extreme work I did across many labs including mostly uncredited work, and what that same institution induced, would still be Kafkaesque and unacceptable.

Niaz, perhaps an "opposing view", though someone I really like, was my other principle investigator together with Chenliang, for whose group I did a lot of programming, engineering, data generation and pipeline-optimizing, schematic-creating, and grant-idea-providing-and-writing work. When Chenliang told me he couldn't be my advisor, I asked Niaz if she could be. She said she couldn't, because she was in the Mechanical Engineering department and that the process of transferring departments isn't easy enough to be my new advisor, and that maybe she could reach out to the Dean about my concerns. She also advised that I reach out to the CARE Network, something I at first took some mild offense to, because I'd relayed to her some of that trauma with specifics, and she clarified, no, she meant reaching out to them for a lawyer. I appreciated that.  I'm grateful Chenliang forced me on that project. But, I did a lot for them in the Mechanical Engineering department, concurrent with my studies in AI separately in his lab, and I had no choice because that project's grants, that I helped write, was the source of my funding, with their names as authors and me uncredited. As mentioned, I did a lot of engineering and data work that was independent to my research for them, that ordinarily would get paid a 6-figure salary for, while I have never been paid more than $15/hr in my life.

However, that lab is the least of the work I did ([here](https://github.com/slerman12/Detective-Sam/blob/main/5-Early-work-in-program.md)/[here](https://github.com/slerman12/Detective-Sam/blob/main/6-Indebted.md)/[here](https://github.com/AGI-init/UnifiedML-legacy)/[here](https://github.com/AGI-init/XRDs)/[here](https://github.com/slerman12/Builder)/[here](https://github.com/AGI-init/Tributaries)/[here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ZQFeiOKSU2teVGg5EHlgREAi8pJY_Mr1CJ3H2pfFBfI/edit?usp=sharing)).

For all of the aforementioned reasons, and final, I was terminated without degree. 6 years of hard work thrown away and spit on, with no accountability, from the same single monopoly and institution that induced multiple medical malpractices on me, mutilated me into looking like Gollum literally, and put me through a literal physiological coerced burning hellfire for more than a year that can't be described. Meanwhile, the 6 years in the program involved two advisors leaving due to no fault of my own, and extremely unreasonable grad school action, that goes in contrast to how much I actually did and how hard I worked more than they'll ever realize. I mentioned that in the second 3 years, I had to work for the Mechanical Engineering department, on research independent from my AI research. I can throw away that in the first 3, I had to work in the Medical Center for funding, even for a time as I worked for Chenliang for free. I built a whole machine learning web app for them, professional and beautiful, a web app that prognosticated a patient's Parkinson's disease progression based on inputs using machine learning models that I trained, that they later outsourced to other much-higher-paid programmers who could scale it, and patented it, then ignored the fact that it was my idea, that I had to convince them of the idea, prove that it gets good reception by presenting it to major researchers at a conference in DC in front of them (uncredited), and that I literally built a fully functioning and elegant prototype, concluding with all of them pretending that I had no involvement as they were handing it over to build from scratch to a hired professional web dev team with me trying to chime in and getting ignored at the table as if it was a brand new idea that they didn't realize was in any way affiliated with me, and perhaps that was necessary for the patent. That's a throw-away. Keep reading, just wait. There's really no end to the egregiousness of what the University of Rochester has bureaucratically instituted in their learning and healing centers, against every principle both of those institutions have ever claimed to hold. 

Finally, Deans Wendi Heinzelman and Nick Vamivakas, who I flooded with a ton of emails, were CC’d on all of this, and didn’t reply to any of them — including, “Thanks Nick, I appreciate this.” about the Israel-Gaza situation affecting Jewish students that Nick sent out en-masse on the final October 31st day (about students-only university support groups for the Israel-Gaza situation, on the day I was denounced as a student). I mistakenly thought it was a email directly to me since maybe he learned that my family, including me, immigrated here as Jewish refugees. No, he never addressed me. It was also immediately before my birthday for that matter, but I’m sure these personal details don’t matter to them. They never acknowledged me, not a single reply.

> Note: None of these words do me justice. These words come from the trauma-mouth of some psychological framework that overtakes my genuine voice, rooted in memory of that institution's work culture.
