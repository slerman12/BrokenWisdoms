# Opposing views

The opposing view in defense of my university-hospital doctor is, she might have had something else going on, or was too busy. Later, she took pictures of the hair loss with her nurse and diagnosed it honestly as alopecia universalis due to the sudden cessation of Dupilumab. The opposing view in defense of my university-provided health insurance company Aetna is, they maybe didn’t notice that I had already been on the drug for a long time (I don’t remember the exact duration but between 6 months and 1 year) and wanted to save money. In defense of the university intermediaries who were in charge of providing and delivering the drug on a recurring schedule, they couldn’t contact the doctor and the doctor might have been on vacation or any other reason she might not have been reachable at the time; and, as mentioned, she was honest in directly diagnosing the rapid loss of my hair to the sudden cessation of Dupilumab. 

I should add one for the doctors who coerced the benzodiazepine prescriptions and brain damaged me.

In defense of Chenliang: he eventually accepted me into his lab after Henry left, pressured me into writing a paper sooner, and stayed generally nice throughout the time, while not expressing judgement towards my social anxiety. He sometimes had a good understanding of AI. His spirit, sometimes, seemed to promise me many things. He contradictorily seemed to respect my slower publication pace while I built UnifiedML, and I believed he fully knew that I was intelligent enough to warrant his investment. Also, 2 publications in 3 years is (I think) less than his average student.

Michael, bumped my grade up in undergrad. Wasn't judgmental, sent a "talk?" email and one previous invitation to meet, though he didn't reply to my acceptance to meet. (1) "I would be glad to meet in person, but I ask that you restore my stipend for the month of November. Thank you.", and (2) "Hi Michael, I’d be willing to meet. But please extend my stipend through November.". My birthday's in November, and October is when these emails, including the "talk?" email (October 20th), were sent. My emails were harsher, and I also warned him that I was going to [email the CS grad department](https://github.com/slerman12/Detective-Sam/blob/main/3-Grads-Alliance.md) 3 days before I did. He tolerated my emails as I tried to defend myself, but ultimately defended the committee's decision to terminate, though strictly speaking, a decision he was at least the sole messenger in. In defense of Michael, he mentioned the possibility of applying for reinstatement, though what that means is unclear, especially without advisor or funding for a 6th-year student who was already forced to switch advisors once in the third year when that advisor got promoted to a prestigious directing job at the NSF. In defense of the committee, most of them didn't know me and hadn't met each other or me previously, and one of them, in a kind of *deus ex machina* (or so I thought, since that should have conclusively settled it), [mis-remembered](https://github.com/slerman12/Detective-Sam/blob/main/4-Faith.md) the short 30-minute Zoom meeting that the four of us had as being 1.5 hours and twice. That is quite a lapse in memory. The meeting was 30 minutes, and once, as the other committee members may confirm, as it was scheduled for 30 minutes: 20 minutes reserved for my presentation and the last 10 minutes for their independent-room discussion and final remarks. In defense of them, Chenliang said the committee members thought I dropped the line early, but I did a "bless you" sign with my hands after what I thought was their final remarks. I'm guessing they didn't see and I thought the meeting was over since they conveyed everything I had to do next, which I did. At the very, very end of the meeting, one of the committee members, Tom Howard, said, “I just want to add, I think it’s important.” I actually in my altered state of consciousness thought he meant my work (he probably meant the chapter-list), so I did a sincere and prolonged “bless you” symbol and left. (This is sincere, but it's the least believable part). Chenliang knew I hadn’t slept that whole night, due to insomnia and maybe-nervousness, as I let him know prior to the meeting and on previous circumstances through Slack, and I mentioned it during the meeting. Since Charles Venuto was the only person on the committee who knew me since I began the program, when I worked for him in the Medical Center in my undergard and in the first 3 years of my PhD, including at one point as my only source of funding, concurrently with PhD work, I reassured him via email, without prompt, not to worry, out of that same kind of sincere/maybe-naive kindness that I suspect is hard to believe. The other previous committee members had not been available for reasons that had nothing to do with me. Independent to that meeting, and prior to any confrontations or required deadlines, Chenliang stated that he would no longer support me in the Fall due to not enough papers.

> They might have more points to add in defense of them, but I suspect those points would deviate from the facts.
