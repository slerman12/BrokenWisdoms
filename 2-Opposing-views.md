# Opposing views

## Part 1 

- **University-provided health insurance (Aetna)**
- **University-hospital doctor**
- **University-owned drug deliverer**

In the summer prior to my first year as a PhD student, my university-hospital doctor Lisa Beck prescribed a medication called Dupilumab. It's a biologic agent that you inject into your stomach that laser-targets a specific antibody associated with eczema. My eczema was severe and debilitating. Some time into taking the medication — I think maybe 8 months — my university-provided health insurance Aetna cut me off from the drug without warning. I wasn't notified by Aetna or my doctor, or the university-owned hospital that would otherwise bill me, but by the university-owned intermediary deliverer, who was responsible for delivering the drug on a recurring basis to my doorstep, since it can't — or at least at the time couldn't — be provided for pick-up at a pharmacy. They called me and told me they couldn't reach my doctor, but for some reason Aetna had decided to no longer cover the prescription. I remember walking up and down Mt. Hope Avenue with my phone in a panic calling my doctor trying to reach her, and the university deliverer telling me they were trying to do the same and couldn't reach her either. After a while, my hair started falling out rapidly. I have no genetic predisposition to baldness, from any side of my family. The abnormally rapid hair loss was obviously due to the dependency and cessation. 

Though it fell out quickly, I didn't notice at first. The shower drains were filled with hair every day, and I thought it was maybe my housemate's girlfriend's. I didn't get to see my doctor until later in the Spring, a long time after, when I think much of the side and top of my head were bald. She diagnosed it as Alopecia Areata as a result of the sudden cessation of Dupilumab. To be clear, she diagnosed it as Alopecia Areata as a result of the sudden cessation of Dupilumab. She and her nurse took pictures and stored them in the university-hospital computers. 

Eventually, she sorted out things with the university-provided health insurance, but by then it was too late. Most of my hair had fallen out.

We finally got a delivery of the drug. I wasn’t sure whether it’d be safer at that point to re-instigate the dependency/addiction or avoid the drug at all costs.

Here's a personal story, since I was fixated with Taoism at the time:

To help me weigh the difficult decision — and it was difficult because that medication was extremely potent and didn't even help my eczema much, and I believed my hair would grow back — I asked the I Ching. Here I'll describe the hexagrams I got because I find it interesting that one of the predictions came true, and this might be medically useful since it corresponded thrice with my hair growing back (all three resurgences after the Alopecia Areata had developed into Alopecia Universalis, meaning after every piece of hair from my body had fallen out).

The I Ching "answered" it didn’t matter which of the two paths I chose ("The town may be changed, / But the well cannot be changed. / It neither decreases nor increases." - "The Well", unchanging). (Maybe an interesting observation: that the English "well" is phonetically similar to "wellness", as well). It also had previously "answered" my hair would grow back of its own accord, which it did, temporarily. I still remember: “Difficulty at the beginning” (as Richard Wilhelm described: “The name of the hexagram, Chun, really connotes a blade of grass pushing against an obstacle as it sprouts out of the earth — hence the meaning, 'Difficulty at the beginning'.”) $\rightarrow$ (changes to) “Fellowship with man” (e.g., baldness). That answer about whether my hair’d grow back came true with the all-steak diet (steak is "manly" and so that again ties to the hexagram symbolism of "Fellowship with man"), almost like a suggestion for how my hair could “sprout” out of the earth, my head, again… which it did, temporarily but covering my entire head except for an unnoticeable patch at the top of my scalp.

Then all the hair fell out again. Again, total baldness. No eyelashes, eyebrows, or hair.

Another time I did the all-steak diet, my pubic hair grew back — temporarily.

Another time I did the all-steak diet, a few eyelashes grew back for the first time. 

That can’t be a coincidence, so I leave this story here both for medical utility and for the understanding that [I now look like Gollum](https://www.facebook.com/photo/?fbid=10211230008185126&set=a.1273659620707) because of medical malpractice.

> By the way, the scariest nightmare I ever had, over and over that whole night, was the day I injected Dupilumab the first time. I remember my housemate at the time in the other room and I wanted to wake him. That's how scared I was. The nightmare was of a tall skinny slenderman, who kept approaching to rape me. Every time I closed my eyes and fell asleep, he'd reappear. Again and again, for that whole night. I never had a nightmare like that before. It was vivid.

## Part 2.

- **University coercers**
- **University-mandated assaulters**
- **University-commissioned clinical monsters**

(In progress)

I should add one for the doctors who coerced the benzodiazepine prescriptions and brain damaged me. I was going to leave it out because it was excruciatingly traumatic and is hard to revisit. In the hospital they forced me to take many orders higher a dosage than I had ever taken, at extremely-many orders higher the frequency, and promised to wean me off before I left the hospital. Last-minute, they changed their minds and said the outpatient doctor would wean me off. He didn't, and I was on them for 6 months at an extreme dosage. When I told him of the severely worsening cognitive impairments, he wanted to increase the dosage. Prior to this, I used to take the medication on an as-needed basis, at most once every 2 weeks, prescribed to help eczema-related stress and social anxiety, about a quarter of a milligram, and that much gave me hangovers. They coerced me in the hospital to take many orders more than that 3x per day, every day. At first, it was like being drunk every day and pleasant. After a month, I was in cognitive decline. After a few months, the experience was like burning in Hell. Excruciating agony, on top of inability to think or remember. All the while I begged my doctors to wean me off and argued *to them* the dangers of benzodiazepines, since they first forced me onto them at that dosage at the hospital, coercively, *against* my will, at the threat of court order. Even "they were just doing their jobs" doesn't cut it. They were coerced onto me. I was in severe agony three months in, the doctor refused to help with the taper and wanted to increase the dose, then I was in severely far worse agony six months in. I had no choice and had to taper off by myself, and thank God I did because at that point, call it what you want, I was literally brain damaged undergoing active chemical waterboarding. That Hell from the GABA downregulation didn't go away for more than a year. Every neuron in my brain was behaving as if I was being mauled by a bear, without pause, day and night, every minute.

Benzodiazepines are GABA agonists. That means they activate GABA receptors in the brain. GABA is the mechanism of action of drugs like alcohol, but benzos are worse. Benzos are like shots of alcohol in pill form, but they seem better because they don't have the same kind of hangover effect. They're at least as addictive and dangerous as opioids, and studies do not show their long-term effiacy — in fact, the opposite, since as far back as the 90s. They are alcohol in a pill but worse because your body hasn't evolved to clean them from your brain like it has the fermentations of fruits. However, despite being synthetic, they are a system-wide drug. Your brain's two primary neurotransmitters are GABA and Gutamate. They're the chemical messengers that pass signals from neuron to neuron, everywhere in your brain. GABA inhibits the next neuron from firing. Glutamate excites the next neuron. Every part of your brain, from your temporal lobe where the Amygdala and Hippocampus control emotion and long-term memory, to the frontl lobe, where your knowledge of self and higher-order thinking are conducted, operate by the mechanism of GABA and Glutamate. Nobody understands this mechanism. To understand this mechanism, you'd have to solve all of neurology and artificial intelligence, and psychiatrists understand it least of all, since they don't primarily study either. Benzos are a floodbath of GABA to your brain, that your brain responds to by "downregulation": every neuron in the brain that produces or receives GABA (that's almost every neuron in the brain) is directly affected. So we don't even understand the mechanisms of long-term memory and these psychiatrists feel equipped to coerce their own interventions on that and everything else in the brain. Lack of GABA, as a result of GABA downregulation, then results in more of your neurons firing, which leads to epilleptic seizures frequently as a result of benzodiazepine usage. It also leads to immense Hell, since GABA is the mechanism for anxiety reduction. Think of the most anxious you've ever been in your life. Having your brain's GABA downregulated is like living actively in a warzone. It is, without exageration, a form of legal torture. Coerced benzo usage is akin to waterboarding.

There were further terrors at the University of Rochester Medical Center that I don't want to get into (one of the easier ones to point out, that happened later, was my big toe getting running over by the wheelchair I was in as the nurse pushed it, me screaming in pain, and with the nurse rolling me off and other nurses all ignoring). Concurrent with this, while I was still in withdrawal from the benzodiazepines and after my third year in the PhD program, I was forced to switch from being Henry Kautz's student because Henry got a prestigious position offer to direct at the NSF that he accepted. In defense of Henry, he'd already done a lot for me, and had no formal background or experience with deep learning to facilitate my research studies compared to, who he recommended, Chenliang Xu, whose lab I had to then fight to get into, with an ultimatum pressed on me to write a top-venue paper, from scratch, by the end of that summer for him or be rejected advisor-less from the PhD program.

In defense of Chenliang: he eventually accepted me into his lab (when I succesfully delivered that paper, even early, while still in the nightmare depths of the benzo withdrawal), and stayed generally nice throughout the time, while not expressing judgement towards my social anxiety. He sometimes had a good understanding of AI, better than others at the university. His spirit, sometimes, felt extraordinarily supportive. He contradictorily wanted efficiency with somewhat respecting my slower publication pace while I built UnifiedML, and I believed he fully knew that I was intelligent enough to warrant investing faith in. While 2 publications in 3 years is (I think) less than his average student, that was, however, his only reason for terminating me when I was in my sixth year, three years later.

<img width="600" alt="Screenshot 2024-03-12 at 8 10 34 PM" src="https://github.com/slerman12/Detective-Sam/assets/9126603/2e3e2104-4a3c-46e1-b6e7-9d453e1b8464">
</p>

In defense of the committee members who agreed on the decision, most of them didn't know me and hadn't met each other or me previously, and one of them, in a kind of *deus ex machina* (or so I thought, since that should have conclusively settled it), [mis-remembered](https://github.com/slerman12/Detective-Sam/blob/main/4-Faith.md) the short 30-minute Zoom only meeting that the four of us had, on which these decisions from their end were based, as being 1.5 hours and twice. That is quite a lapse in memory. The meeting was 30 minutes, and once, as the other committee members may recall and confirm. And, the calendar invitation that that committee member, Chris Kanan, accepted, wrote: "Friday May 5, 2023 ⋅ 1pm – 1:45pm (Eastern Time - New York)" (extra lag time added). Also, I have on email to one committee member Tom Howard that we planned half an hour: "Would you be available any of the following dates for a half-hour remote 6-month review?" So, as can be easily confirmed or sufficiently evidenced, it was indeed 30 minutes with our brand new committee in which I had to summarize 6 years of work over Zoom: 20ish minutes spent on my presentation and the remaining on their independent-room discussion and concluding remarks. The independent-room discussion reasonably marked the end of my portion of the meeting, or so I thought. However, after the independent-room discussion, we kept talking, I left, and Chenliang later told me that the committee members thought I dropped the line early. That was a misunderstanding. I really thought the meeting was over since they conveyed everything I had to do next, or at least that they were going to in that discussion. At the very, very end of the discussion, one of the committee members, Tom Howard, said, “I just want to add, I think it’s important.” I actually in my sleep deprivation thought he meant my work (I know he probably meant the chapter-list), so I did a sincere and prolonged “bless you” sign with my hands in the silence and left. I know that this is the least believable part. Chenliang knew I hadn’t slept that whole night, due to insomnia and maybe-nervousness, and I mentioned that I "didn't sleep all night" during the meeting to which I think Tom Howard off-handedly, maybe-non-noticedly said "I know," before resuming his point. Since Charles Venuto was the only person on the committee who knew me since I began the program, when I worked for him in the Medical Center in my undergrad and in the [first 3 years](https://github.com/slerman12/Detective-Sam/blob/main/5-Early-work-in-program.md) of my PhD, including at one point as my funding source for my PhD even as I worked for free for Chenliang, I reassured him via email, without prompt, not to worry, out of that same sincere/maybe-naive kindness that I suspect is hard to believe. The other previous committee members, from those [first 5 years of my PhD](https://github.com/slerman12/Detective-Sam/blob/main/6-Indebted.md), had not been available for reasons that had nothing to do with me (besides my first advisor leaving, there was also retirement, sabbatical, and then second advisor leaving — 4 huge unexpected departures that the grad school should've had to be accountable for). After the meeting, I was formally sent two requirements, one with a June 5th deadline and another with a August 30th deadline. In addition to that, committee member Chris Kanan made recommendations on email that I innovate some new systems-level RL algorithm for UnifiedML. It was a good vague suggestion. I actually did this, successfully, and reported it to Chenliang later. I also met the first deadline, with everything as requested and additional information and longer page-count. Independent to that meeting, and prior to any confrontations or that second deadline, Chenliang stated that he would no longer support me in the Fall due to not enough papers, on July 24th. I achieved 2 papers in the 3 years under Chenliang and was in the middle of a paper review. On August 30th, I informed the grad school of everything and missed the make-up review, matching another time, as Michael will illucidate, that I missed a review due to highly extenuating and excused circumstances. After multiple contradictory reasons, they finally decided this (the missed August 30th make-up review) was the reason for terminating me in my sixth year as a PhD student (and tenth at the University of Rochester). In summary, a brand new committee, who had never met me, decided to confer with my advisor's decision, for altogether different "reasons".

Now, in defense of Dr. Michael L. Scott, the messenger:

<p align="center">
<img width="200" alt="Screenshot 2024-03-12 at 8 10 54 PM" src="https://github.com/slerman12/Detective-Sam/assets/9126603/842ceaeb-90cc-49cf-b885-961c05a61de8">
</p>

Michael doesn't know this, but he bumped my grade up in undergrad once. Now he ultimately relayed the ruling to terminate, on the basis of the committee, and not one, but, as he claimed, [two](https://github.com/slerman12/Detective-Sam/blob/main/7-Ongoing.md) six-month reviews. Michael mentioned the possibility of applying for reinstatement, though what that means is unclear, especially as: Did he mean I needed to find yet another advisor, new source of funding, re-take a six-month review, do my thesis, and do all of this amid health issues in my sixth year, for less than New York State's legal living wage, within the next one to few months? 

Something I didn't mention or elaborate on here yet: Chenliang lied, as soon as I sent [my first email](https://github.com/slerman12/Detective-Sam/blob/main/4-Faith.md) to the committee. Here's a story that Chenliang knows is true: After he notified me of his leaving and my income being cut, I reached out my hand to shake his hand, he didn't shake it, and then I said, "I consider you someone I personally hold dear", and patted my heart with my hand as I left his office and another student entered. I meant it. That's why I refrained from telling the other committee members and Michael that Chenliang lied in his reply email until after they had formally notified me of my termination. This was the fabrication, on email: "Dr. Niaz Abdolrahim delivered my message to you [... that] I can continue to provide funding support (Sep, Oct, Nov)." No, she did not. She didn't say anything about continued funding support. She can confirm, though she didn't risk their professional relationship by replying either when I CC'd her. Even if she had offered any words of financial security for between then and November, November time limit before losing my funding and having to find my third PhD advisor, in my sixth year, on short-notice, in the context of the extreme work I did across many labs including mostly uncredited work, and what that same institution induced, would still be Kafkaesque and unacceptable.

Niaz, perhaps an "opposing view", though someone I really like, was my other principle investigator together with Chenliang, for whose group I did a lot of programming, engineering, data generation and pipeline-optimizing, schematic-creating, and grant-idea-providing-and-writing work. When Chenliang told me he couldn't be my advisor, I asked Niaz if she could be. She said she couldn't, because she was in the Mechanical Engineering department and that the process of transferring departments isn't easy enough to be my new advisor, and that maybe she could reach out to the Dean about my concerns. She also advised that I reach out to the CARE Network, something I at first took some mild offense to, because I'd relayed to her some of that trauma with specifics, and she clarified, no, she meant reaching out to them for a lawyer. I appreciated that.  I'm grateful Chenliang forced me on that project. But, I did a lot for them in the Mechanical Engineering department, concurrent with my studies in AI separately in his lab, and I had no choice because that project's grants, that I helped write, was the source of my funding, with their names as authors and me uncredited. As mentioned, I did a lot of engineering and data work that was independent to my research for them, that ordinarily would get paid a 6-figure salary for, while I have never been paid more than $15/hr in my life.

However, that lab is the least of the work I did ([here](https://github.com/slerman12/Detective-Sam/blob/main/5-Early-work-in-program.md)/[here](https://github.com/slerman12/Detective-Sam/blob/main/6-Indebted.md)/[here](https://github.com/AGI-init/UnifiedML-legacy)/[here](https://github.com/AGI-init/XRDs)/[here](https://github.com/slerman12/Builder)/[here](https://github.com/AGI-init/Tributaries)/[here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ZQFeiOKSU2teVGg5EHlgREAi8pJY_Mr1CJ3H2pfFBfI/edit?usp=sharing)).

For all of the aforementioned reasons, and final, I was terminated without degree. 6 years of hard work thrown away and spit on, with no accountability, from the same single monopoly and institution that induced multiple medical malpractices on me, mutilated me into looking like Gollum literally, and put me through a literal physiological coerced burning hellfire for more than a year that can't be described. Meanwhile, those years in the program involved two advisors leaving due to no fault of my own, and extremely unreasonable grad school action, that goes in contrast to how much I actually did and how hard I worked more than they'll ever realize. I mentioned that in the second 3 years, I had to work for the Mechanical Engineering department, on research independent from my AI research. I can throw away that in the first 3, I had to work in the Medical Center for funding, even for a time as I worked for Chenliang for free. I built a whole machine learning web app for them, professional and beautiful, a web app that prognosticated a patient's Parkinson's disease progression based on inputs using machine learning models that I trained, that they later outsourced to other much-higher-paid programmers who could scale it, and patented it, then ignored the fact that it was my idea, that I had to convince them of the idea, prove that it gets good reception by presenting it to major researchers at a conference in DC in front of them (uncredited), and that I literally built a fully functioning and elegant prototype, concluding with all of them pretending that I had no involvement as they were handing it over to build from scratch to a hired professional web dev team with me trying to chime in and getting ignored at the table as if it was a brand new idea that they didn't realize was in any way affiliated with me, and perhaps that was necessary for the patent. That's a throw-away. Keep reading, just wait. There's really no end to the egregiousness of what the University of Rochester has bureaucratically instituted in their learning and healing centers, against every principle both of those institutions have ever claimed to hold. 

Finally, Deans Wendi Heinzelman and Nick Vamivakas, who I flooded with a ton of emails, were CC’d on all of this, and didn’t reply to any of them — including, “Thanks Nick, I appreciate this.” about the Israel-Gaza situation affecting Jewish students that Nick sent out en-masse on the final October 31st day (about students-only university support groups for the Israel-Gaza situation, on the day I was denounced as a student). I mistakenly thought it was a email directly to me since maybe he learned that my family, including me, immigrated here as Jewish refugees. No, he never addressed me. It was also immediately before my birthday for that matter, but I’m sure these personal details don’t matter to them. They never acknowledged me, not a single reply.

> Note: None of these words do me justice. These words come from the trauma-mouth of some psychological framework that overtakes my genuine voice, rooted in memory of that institution's culture.
