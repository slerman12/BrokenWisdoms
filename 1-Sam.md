‚ÄúWho is Sam?‚Äù is what the congress asks. They call in everyone except him to find out. One by one the lineup proceeds. 

‚ÄúWho is Sam?‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, he‚Äôs this guy. I saw this guy on the internet once. it‚Äôs him!‚Äù 

‚ÄúWho is Sam?‚Äù

‚ÄúOh he‚Äôs a shy guy. He‚Äôs really smart.‚Äù

‚ÄúWho is ‚Äî‚Äú

There‚Äôs no answer because the person writing this doesn‚Äôt know. The observer knows, but he doesn‚Äôt write with language, he doesn‚Äôt speak with tone of voice, he doesn‚Äôt detach the symbols from the reality that is his skin and whole.
