Subject: **Graduate student firing** </br>
To: **Chenliang, Tom, Chris, Charles, Graduate Student Collective** </br>
From: **Sam Lerman**

Hi everyone,

Due to the circumstances that Chenliang can catch the committee up on, I have involuntarily been put on strike.

When funding issues are resolved, and the department has resolved on how to resolve them, I can do the original formal meeting originally required of me.

Thank you,</br>
Sam

Also,

At this time, I’m searching for a new advisor, as per Chenliang’s recommendation. That means with the return of Robbie Jacobs from sabbatical, who has been on my committee since the start, and presumably the continued committee-service/presence of my advisor Chenliang, and the inevitable addition of Niaz Abdolrahim, who leads the XRD project at the center of my thesis and with whom we wrote the grants, that leaves room for only one more committee member and that person would have to in fact be my new advisor. So unless there are volunteers from the current committee, this email may be our last formal communication. I wish you all well.

P.S. I am technically fired at this time (for “not enough papers”). Like the officer made to put in his badge in the 4th act of the movie, naturally I shall be re-vindicated by movie’s end.

Due to the University of Rochester’s multiple medical malpractices against me (yes, not exaggerating), the years of preventable unnatural physical trauma (I mean this seriously), and already having switched advisors due to my first one getting a promotion, in addition to having worked upwards 80 hours per week at less-than a minimum wage, not to mention having co-written and proposed the central idea of the grant by which we’re being funded, and more… there’s a lot for the University of Rochester to seriously account for. Those medical damages in particular, which were indeed malpractices, from individual and multiple doctors and divisions of the medical center, while I was employed, with University of Rochester serving as the governing body on all fronts: employer, medical healer, and insurance provider, the latter of which there were extremely unethical issues as well with one drug in particular being spontaneously cut off from me while my body was physically dependent.

Some context that I wrote while not in the mental condition to do anything: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Badpill/comments/ccu0az/phd_student_with_bright_future_life_ruined_by/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3](https://github.com/slerman12/BrokenWisdoms/assets/9126603/41a9dab9-db10-4cfa-9405-32e8c599a893) Note the dosage prescribed to me was orders of magnitude higher than I had ever taken. I protested, but they forced me to at the threat of court order while I was in the hospital for a month, at which point I was physically addicted. I used to take 1/24th the dosage every few weeks at most and that much would give me hangovers, so try to imagine what 24x that much daily for >6 months did to me. 3 months in, I begged my doctor to taper because of the worsening cognitive symptoms. He refused. He advised increasing the dose instead. Eventually I had to taper by myself. Thank God I did because at that point I was brain damaged.

The worst of this is not even described.

By the way, I went in (that is, at the very beginning of all this) for just eczema, when I started my PhD. And now I have no hair, eyebrows, or eyelashes. 

The severe trauma induced under the overhang of the University of Rochester includes both illegal and extremely unethical practices for which I intend to get a reasonable and fair settlement, as well as to still finish my PhD, for which I am 6 years in, am published in one of the world’s top conferences, and am presently in the middle of a review response for a paper that our PI said: “I think this one will get accepted.” Not that any of this context matters given the severity of the actions of the University of Rochester as the governing body of the medical, employeeship, and insurance situations that all failed to collaborate and coordinate in an individual let alone relational manner as they dragged me through their respective systems.

Humor’s sake footnote: Speaking of systems, my committee asked me to divise a new systems algorithm, so I did, even though it’s not my area of study. I presented it to my advisor and he actually seemed satisfied, but who knows. Not the SAT-solving one, the one after. But even Henry wouldn’t have been able to satisfy in these conditions. ba dum cha

I have attached the Graduate Student Collective and for the time being am preferring to keep this private.

Addendum: 

This is my best, a lot of information is left out, and the intention now is to get a settlement.

I feel it understresses the actual medical malpractice nature of what happened.

For example, when I was cut off from the drug, it took more than a month to reach my doctor through excessive calls to and from an intermediary with Dupilumab, and I was already running late on my prescription. Meanwhile, the intermediary was telling me that my doctor had to negotiate with the insurance. There were multiple /surprisingly/ independent malpractices, starting with what happened with Dupilumab.

Some points:</br>
(1) The intermediary was perhaps owned by the University of Rochester.</br>
(2) They should have been tracking such things as extremely potent injected medications being spontaneously cut off long into a patient's developed physical dependence on them.</br>
(3) It shouldn't be an entire war just to reach your doctor.</br>
(4) The intermediary couldn't reach her either.</br>
(5) After a short stall period, all of the hair on my body fell out within a week. The doctor took pictures and agreed it was pretty much definitely because of the Dupilumab withdrawal, a potent biologic agent that is injected via needle into the stomach and bloodstream to target a specific antibody associated with eczema, prescribed to me for a full year. Did it help with my eczema at least during that year? A little, but not much. At the price of all of my hair, including eyelashes, and my social and mental health.</br>

And that's just medical malpractice 1, before the benzos and surprisingly multiple malpractices equally egregious after.

How does being fired for “not enough papers” relate to all of this? Well, for humor’s sake, consider this my John Wick moment. The feather that broke the camel’s back. Compared to the medical trauma I’ve endured, being fired isn’t quite as scary. However, I still have massive student debt that I have to pay off, in fact to the University of Rochester since here is where I did my undergrad. Since I come from low-income means, my student debt is subsidized for (only) as long as I’m a student. That means, if I’m fired, I have to pay you the University of Rochester a massive severance. Does this sound fair?

* I co-wrote and proposed the central idea of the grant that is funding my PIs millions of dollars, as well as contributed significantly to the next one. 
* Henry’s (under who I got accepted) average PhD student had 1 - 3 publications.
* The university has conducted extreme medical malpractices repeatedly, egregious ones over the course of many years, worsening my physical health in permanent and highly damaging ways. For this reason especially, a major multi-million settlement is due.
    * Hair, brain damage, relationships, trauma, psychosis/worse. Over 5 years. All of this to treat my eczema, which they failed to do.

Some additional points:

* The university might claim that medical malpractice 1 and medical malpractice 2 were independent and coincidental, but the chronology is: (1) Sam is a straight A student with no history of such conditions, accepted into a PhD program. (2) Sam loses all of his hair (3) Brain damage. Medical malpractice 1 caused the events that led to medical malpractice 2, not just coincidence! They exponentiate.
* The original prescription of those benzos, by the way, was to help with stress from eczema when I was in college.
* My short story that I posted on Reddit. In case of questioning about later things I got hospitalized for.
    * https://docs.google.com/document/d/12J4EiZbRIXYYYIJImJJsOhlFTUxwRufA48UKhZEuMlM/edit?usp=sharing
* It was so bad that my teeth calcified and my dentist said it was caused by dry mouth due to benzos.
    * You can actually still observe it on my teeth, the calcification 
* During those hospitalizations, severely abusive things happened. Like to give one example, they ran over my big toe with the wheelchair I was sitting in. I started screaming “My toe! My toe! Ahh!” The nurses kept rolling the chair and ignored it. The actual examples I’d give are more traumatic and I’d prefer not to revisit them. Nothing I’ve been through was more scary than the hell that was those hospitals, except the relationship fallouts that corresponded after, not before. On record, their reason for one of those hospitalizations was “he wasn’t eating enough.” That has never been confirmed. I was eating a lot on an extremely strict diet that helped my eczema, a diet that they forced me off of because “not enough carbs”. And my eczema returned severely.

Hello everyone, 

As an FYI the UR graduate collective is not a UR sanctioned group and should not have been copied in on this email with such personal information. Perhaps, Sam, you meant to send this to GEPA or University Graduate Education.

Please be sure that the collective email is removed prior to sending communications. 

Thank you, </br>
