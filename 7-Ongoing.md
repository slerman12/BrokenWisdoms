Hi Michael, 

Was this six-month review mentioned at/between the time of my termination and October 31st?

Hi Sam —

I’m not sure which review you’re referring to: the one you skipped in Fall 2022, the unsuccessful one in Spring 2023, or the make-up review that you didn’t schedule.<sup>$^\text{\color{purple}[1.]}$</sup>  The requirement for reviews is documented in the CS PhD Student Handbook.  Deadlines for reviews are communicated to all PhD students and advisors via email every year.

— Michael

<sup>$\text{\color{purple}[1.]:}$ In all cases, the answer was `"no."` I should’ve replied: <code>"The one that I was excused from, the one that I attended with a brand new <i>interim</i> committee, or the one that was post-hoc both with respect to advisor-desertion and requirement?”</code> Unlike what Michael's reply makes it sound like, his termination email didn't attribute my termination to any of these things, but rather to my research, e.g., the extremely-false reason given in the termination email was: "the plan you outline is neither consistent with what you originally proposed for the PhD nor a viable path to completion of the degree." Meanwhile, my advisor and PI both said my plan was completed successfully and I was ready to defend that month. Whereas, they were all wrong: I needed more time to write a good thesis.</sup>

### Email: 02/09/2024

Re: **Supporting students**</br>
To: **Michael, Graduate Coordinator Robin, Chenliang, Grad Student Association (ASE GSA)** </br>
From: **Sam Lerman**

Hi Michael,

I was excused from the one I missed in Fall, 2022, as is detailed below, and remediated it in Spring, 2023, on May, 5th. The one on May, 5th, I passed, with this condition from the committee members: I don't remember the exact phrasing, but "please provide a one-page chapter-list." Specifically, after my 20-minute presentation, and the 5-10 minute independent-room discussion that followed, I was informed of the following additional formal requirements not originally conveyed by the committee, separate from what they decided in the independent-room discussion (not having left early on purpose if I did):

(1) before June 5, 2023, provide a 1-page write up that addresses the problem statement, hypothesis, and approaches of the thesis and give an outline of thesis chapters, </br>
(2) before August 30, 2023, re-do and pass a six-month review.

I sent them the chapter-list as well as a 6-page write-up containing the problem statement, hypothesis, and approaches (and made sure to cleanly summarize those parts on approximately a single page in that write-up), as documented on email also. In total, I sent a 6-page write-up instead of a 1-page write-up as well as the originally required chapter-list. This can't be stressed enough: I sent them more than what they asked, as committee member Chris Kanan stated on email record.

Chenliang told me I left the meeting early. I did not know I left the meeting early, as I told Chenliang, and I'm still not convinced I did, though the evidence for that is hard to argue given that I was sleep-deprived and Chenliang seems to think so. But, Tom Howard had just said "I just want to add, I think it's important," and thinking he meant my work, I did a sincere and prolonged "bless you" sign with my hands in the silence, before dropping the line. The meeting was scheduled for 30 minutes, on email-provable record, and this was both after the independent-room discussion and after the committee had laid out what I had to do next. And yes, I sincerely meant it. Chenliang's students can confirm I've done this in sincerity before, such as after having proposed the BittleBot project.

A six-month review, to remind you, is "an informal meeting meant to help the student." The grad school, not me, should be accountable for committee members and an advisor, and then a second advisor, leaving (especially with short, no, or again short notice).

My question is, since I felt your answer disingenuous: whether the second requirement ("before August 30, 2023, re-do and pass a six-month review.") was mentioned at any point at/between the time of termination and October 31st, by anyone other than me, since, suspiciously: I conveniently mentioned it for you in my grad department email of October 30th.

Regarding Henry's absence, Chenliang was aware from Fall semester into Spring semester that I had missed that six-month review, most likely understanding that: (1) six-month reviews are informal assessments meant to help the student, not live-or-die assessments on which termination can be suspiciously, ambiguously, and retroactively justified long after notice of termination — specifically, October 31st, my last day, following my grad department email on October 30th in which I reminded you that this make-up requirement existed, that chronologically followed after Chenliang's notice of stipend cut, and (2) Henry couldn't attend, which I was not notified of until last-minute — Chenliang, not Henry, notified me, last-minute, just at that six-month review time point, that my former advisor and active committee member was retiring and wouldn't be available. After I was excused — by my advisor, and as far as I could know department — I was not notified again until the Spring one with a new committee, *when, and **in advance of**, one other committee member had left* (Robbie Jacobs). 

Now, to remind you, I also suffered many induced and excruciatingly severe tragedies while I was employed and working as a student that the university did not yet address. 

However, for now, it would mean a lot to me if you could answer my question [yes/no, specify when, and provide a quotation as proof].

This was the question:

> Was this six-month review mentioned at/between the time of my termination and October 31st?

**Since you bring up the PhD student handbook**, here is a direct quote: "When withdrawing support, the faculty will indicate to the student, in writing, what is necessary for reinstatement of support” (Page 15). You must provide in writing that the make-up review was mentioned.

Here is what I was able to find, dated October, 12th: 

> I have conferred with members of your committee.  They confirm that the plan you outline is neither consistent with what you originally proposed for the PhD nor a viable path to completion of the degree.  With regret, we will be terminating your student status and stipend as of the end of October.

Let me elaborate on "the [research] plan you outline is [not] consistent [...] nor a viable path." These judgements had no grounds, with no writing specifying how those assertions were true, as was needed, presumably, for reinstatement — therefore, not satisfying the "what is necessary" requirement written in the PhD handbook. I ask this with all awareness of the context: does "innocent until proven guilty," in determining an employee's termination, hold at the University of Rochester? 

As for the question as to whether I was an employee, note that, by the way, for much of my first 3 years, my PhD funding was provided from clocking in through HRMS at the University of Rochester Medical Center, even serving under Chenliang for free while I did so. However, **as recently as the pre-Trump era**, depending on your definition: 

(1) "For tax purposes, the Internal Revenue Service considers the compensation of graduate student employees to be wages. When graduate students receive payment for teaching, it is not taxed on a 1042-S form (for scholarships), but on a W-2 (which is the form for employment income)." (Wikipedia, ["Graduate student employee unionization"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graduate_student_employee_unionization#:~:text=For%20tax%20purposes%2C%20the%20Internal,the%20form%20for%20employment%20income)). </br>
(2) "Graduate Employee means a graduate student appointed at .20 FTE or greater to provide teaching-related duties, research, or administrative duties." (Law Insider, ["Graduate Employee definition"](https://www.lawinsider.com/dictionary/graduate-employee)).

Furthermore, one of the three, excluding my advisor, committee members, on formal, written record, misremembered provable details about that meeting, such as

(1) how many times we met (he claimed twice rather than once), </br>
(2) and the duration (he claimed 1.5 hours rather than 30 minutes). 

**Since you bring up deadlines**, I was notified of my stipend being cut prior to the six-month review make-up deadline on August 30th, as Chenliang my advisor, the entire committee, and you yourself can confirm, by Chenliang's reply email.

Also, Michael, why does a six-month review make-up have so much weight when I had to report to two labs every action I took every week for the last 3 years?

There was no reply. Michael never answered any of my questions or addressed the things I asked to be addressed, or referred anyone else to address the things I asked to be addressed. Michael and the University of Rochester stayed silent on the whole of the matters conveyed in this repo, to date of writing. Below, in the Epilogue, I will disprove their own judgement using their own policy. But first, Credits.

## <sub>🔎</sub> Reminder of context from [first disproof](https://github.com/slerman12/BrokenWisdoms/blob/main/3-Disproof.md)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The PhD student handbook has **only one clause of accountability** for the grad school, and it's to specify what the PhD student would need to do (without pay or support) for reinstatement:
> - in writing
> - when support is withdrawn

- The only time reinstatement was mentioned was by Michael [on **10/31/2024**](https://github.com/slerman12/BrokenWisdoms/blob/main/3-Disproof.md#email-10312023). No details were given how, on what conditions, and whether any advisor or source of income would be provided, and if not, how to go about obtaining those without any further connections or resources to do so. Having emailed the individual faculty members who might have served as replacements, and met with one and suggested another to the department, there wasn't a path (and none of these things were suggested by the faculty in writing).
- I replied to that reinstatement-mentioning email when it was sent on **10/31/2024**, that is, on my last day of being an employed PhD student, [asking for evidence for the termination reasons](https://github.com/slerman12/BrokenWisdoms/blob/main/3-Disproof.md#hypocrisy) and my reply was ignored. It was the last message sent between us, prior to [these ones](#email-02072024) above that I resumed also currently being ignored. In the [above email](#email-02072024) (the latest of the ignored), I brought up that the reinstatement-condition wasn't indicated to me.
- In that reinstatement-mentioning email that Michael ignored my replies to, Michael had reached out to meet in person, but that wouldn't suffice for reinstatement nor secure my future as an employee with a salary, advisor, and a basic standard of living. The reason for wanting to meet was "mutual understanding." The reinstatement-clause explicitly specifies "in writing."
  - It's taking me a year to write this book. "Mutual understanding" requires at least a book's-worth of traumatic context, that according to Michael, would somehow be better conveyable off-the-record via a meeting while I had no salary or income to an authority in a threatening position, who ignored my replies, hid away from my emailed questions, and disrespected me via a sudden termination email (the Termination Slam) on **10/12/2024** immediately following sending him my sincere research proposal that his previous email specified as the condition for staying in the program (of research that I'd already done, and according to two PIs and former advisor was ready to defend)... and the idea of "proposing" a research "plan" in one's 6th year — already having done the substance of the PhD — is ridiculous, not to mention my advisor's only caveat to graduation that month being that I follow his formatting instructions, ridiculous in itself since I hadn't started writing the thesis yet. Michael didn't approve my plan due to contradictory opinions from a brand new interim committee, despite everything that was communicated and verified to him by email, such as my advisor's opinion that I was ready to defend, the confirmation that my advisor was leaving (second advisor to do so, and again for no particular reason), Chris Kanan's forgetting of details about the meeting ("[Deus Ex Memory](https://github.com/slerman12/BrokenWisdoms/blob/Ancillary/Deus-Ex-Memory.md)"), and all of the [aforementioned trauma](https://github.com/slerman12/BrokenWisdoms/blob/main/2-Opposing-views.md) condensed as much as I could've, communicated and re-visited for him elaborately in real-time in writing.
- I responded to Michael about meeting in person on **10/25/2024**: (1) "Hi Michael, I’d be willing to meet. But please extend my stipend through November," and (2) "I would be glad to meet in person, but I ask that you restore my stipend for the month of November. Thank you." November is my birthday actually.
  - To establish "in person" instead of "in writing" as having been an "implicitly" indicated reinstatement-condition requires rephrasing the reinstatement-clause, foregoing explicit formal communications, and violating ethics by demanding that I participate in an unpaid face-to-face meeting with an authority actively inflicting trauma who has no background or expertise in my field, who has no power to address the issues preventing my reinstatement (e.g. lack of advisor), as the only imaginable grounds for hypothetical reinstatement after a disrespectful, unjustified, un-evidenced termination.
- Support, as distinct from pay, was withdrawn long before Michael or any faculty mentioned reinstatement.
  - As evidenced by my second advisor's communication of withdrawal and reallocation of funding on **07/24/2024**, the sudden termination email on **10/12/2024**, and [many tortures](https://github.com/slerman12/BrokenWisdoms/blob/main/2-Opposing-views.md), including permanent or ongoing ones, inflicted by Michael's institution. To reiterate, all I asked for in the research proposal that Michael slammed with a termination, was peace to write my thesis. That detail was the only part he specified in a later email as having an issue with.
- Note also: the University of Rochester's CS department doesn't have PhD "reinstatement applications." Any appearance of that reinstatement-mentioning email of **10/31/2024** as indicating a reinstatement-condition is gaslighting. The referent of what is mentioned is reinstatement, not a reinstatement-condition. Even if that weren't the case, "in writing" cannot be relegated as "in person" (and thereby “off the record”) unless the indicated reinstatement-condition can redefine the clause from which it's necessitated, but the PhD student handbook isn't a rewritable Turing tape (at least not ad lib), making that absurd to such a point that asserting it becomes gaslighting.

## Definitions

### (1) Necessity of support set.

Define the set of "what is necessary for reinstatement of support, indicated to the student by the faculty, in writing, when support is withdrawn" as the variable $x$.

$x$ $\coloneqq$ $\emptyset$.

That is the empty set, as described in the $\color{#7B52D7} \textbf{&#9432;}$ [context reminder](#-reminder-of-context-from-first-disproof). 

## Propositions

### (1) Goodness, truth, and sufficiency.

Suppose some reasons they had for terminating me were good, true, and sufficient. (False, but assume true).

### (2) Student's negligence.

Suppose I didn’t do something they suggested, requested, or required of me, prior to my second advisor's communication of withdrawal of support. (False, but assume true).

### (3) PhD student handbook.

“When withdrawing support, the faculty will indicate to the student, in writing, what is necessary for reinstatement of support.” - PhD student handbook, page 15. Mathematically:

$\vert x \vert > 0$.

## Disproofs

### (1) Propositions 1 or 2. 

Goodness, truth, and sufficiency; or student's negligence.

**Disproved in [first disproof](https://github.com/slerman12/BrokenWisdoms/blob/main/3-Disproof.md).**

### (2) Proposition 3. 

$\vert x \vert > 0$.

**Disproof.**

$x = \emptyset$. &nbsp; (Definition 1) 

$\rightarrow |x| = 0$ 

$\quad \quad \ \ \not> 0$. &nbsp; $\square$

## Conclusion

- Proposition 3 is the policy of accountability that the PhD student handbook requires the faculty to satisfy.
- Disproof 2 formally disproves the claim of Proposition 3, and proves that the faculty are currently violating the policy of the PhD student handbook.

<p align='center'>𖥸</p>

- An Alderman of the ruling judges ultimately invoked the policy of the PhD student handbook as his justification for the latest in a series of atrocities committed against me by this institution.
- The Alderman initially tried to invoke other reasons for the atrocity, but the reality didn't support him.
- The Alderman is the only ruling judge charged by the University of Rochester to me as the representative of the policies behind those atrocities.
