# Eczema

The universe is filled with the blood of people undeserving its red slash. What if this universe had parameters — let’s say neurons and synaptic connections — by which it could optimize? How would those parameters change as those neurons, all connected by dendrites within a single universe brain, bled at each other’s epilepsies, hemorrhages and structural or neurological damages, shared or unheard memories, coercive interventions, and excitations and inhibitions from the thresholded spikes of membrane potentials distributed within and across each neuron, cortical column, hemisphere, cortex, and the grey matter and nerves of all that is known in the larger cosmic-biological body?

Possibly, as a heuristic for the evolutionary process of change towards a more rewarding qualia, something akin to a ["policy gradient"](http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Policy_gradient_methods) equation in deep reinforcement learning can be allegorically used as reference:

$$
\begin{align}
{\color{red}\theta_{t+1} = \nabla_{\theta_t} A\log(\pi_{\theta_t}(s)) + \theta_t}, \quad\quad \text{(Policy gradient equation in deep reinforcement learning)}
\end{align}
$$

What if those parameters depended on the small sometimes-seemingly-innocent policies that one, one's colleagues, and one's bosses have the power to change (take the gradient of and update) for the purpose of an objective bigger than any system, deep in the minds and hearts of people who live enslaved to them?

## Summary/Resolution

### Lab animals (summary)

I’ve suffered bouts like this all my life, since I was 1-month old. It’s largely stress-induced. Nothing induces it more than prolonged stress periods, especially when heavy debugging is involved. Much of the heavy debugging I did was done out of coercion on behalf of exterior labs, putting me in software-engineer roles, as a PhD student doing orthogonal research, as happened both in the Med Center and the Mechanical Engineering labs, though I made the best of both for my research directions, and my funding depended that I obey their engineering demands in addition to stated PhD requirements. For that reason, the research institution of the University of Rochester, not just education and medical, is guilty for actual, human (not lab-animal, though the distinction might be negligible to their existing policy parameters) bloodshed.

### Yes, bloodshed (summary continued)

Their fascism and ruling practices, which can be reformed, are a source cause of the body's system-wide organism disruptions.

That is, causally, I would not have these wounds and gashes, and would not have had these wounds and gashes in the years that I did if not for the systemic policies of education and medical systems. I was born into persecution, stress, and economic disparity, and the former systems (education and medical) preserved and perpetuated those disorders.

I think something about this might be unconvincing to administrators with no human perspective.

Maybe imagine a person regularly having to crawl to get to the bathroom, as I did, because that person can't unbend their arms and legs, eyes subconsciously squinting with pain, intense pain and itching on every corner of their body, and the body-wide stinging burn if they take a shower. This is a description of me, serving my teachers or emploeyers at the University of Rochester because I had to, by their authority, debug data-cleaning software that I never got credit for, for example, and that had nothing to do with my PhD, still the same example.

This was the price I regularly paid to do some soulless debugging work that I never got credit for.

The severity shown also isn’t the full height of my eczema, nor how widespread it gets (e.g., my neck, face, and full torso).
- The shown gashes are **FAR** from the full severity that I regularly had to work through, through pure willpower, during my PhD.

### Ever better (resolution)

\end{align}
$$

The symbol on the whiteboard, I would propose, can represent healing, healing from within the education, research, and medical systems like the University of Rochester, as those systems change towards "ever better," mathematically. Let this "policy gradient" symbolize the optimization of a purpose — objective or teleology — towards which a maximum metric of "good" can be realized — "ever better." “Ever better” is the University of Rochester’s school motto — either their motto or policy need optimizing.
