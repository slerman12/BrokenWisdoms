# Current Battle Wounds as I Fight Alone

I’ve suffered severe bouts like this all my life, since I was 1-month old. It’s largely stress-induced. Nothing induces it more than prolonged stress periods, especially when heavy debugging is involved. Much of the heavy debugging I did was done out of coercion on behalf of exterior labs, putting me in software-engineer type roles, even though I was a PhD student researcher doing orthogonal research, as happened both in the Med Center and the Mechanical Engineering labs, though I made the best of both for my research directions, and my funding depended that I obey their engineering demands in addition to stated PhD requirements. For that reason, the research institution is also guilty in causing actual bloodshed.

## Towards Ever Better

The symbol on the whiteboard represents healing because it means "ever better", mathematically. It's a policy gradient that represents the optimization of a purpose — objective or teleology — towards its maximum metric realization of "good", as sickness turns to health, or a corrupt academic institution starts to finally change their ways after 2 independent sensationalized scandals to this date in recent history. Of course, “good” needs defining and hopefully some of these case injustices inflicted on me reveal some of what’s missing from the existing sets of metrics. “Ever better” is the University of Rochester’s school motto.

## This might be hard to look at

These "opposing views" are especially unpleasant.

And yet, I fear that nobody will empathize with the role they play in causing these blood wounds and gashes. I'm afraid they'll look at this as pity-pandering and keep practicing the roles that cause these illnesses in the first place, not just in me, but in others, and kids, ubiquitously, more than ever in history.

## Thanks for this, University of Rochester.

This blood is on their hands.

That might sound like a cancel-charge plea, but in actual reality, their fascism and ruling practices, which can be reformed, are the source cause of the injustice conditions that create these ugly skin disorders.


Causally speaking, I would not have these wounds, and would not have had these wounds in the years that I did if not for the systemic policies of lower, middle, and higher education and research and even medical, systems alike, and the persecution, stress, and economic disparity that I was born into.
